Then Moses sent them to the war, one thousand from each tribe; he sent them to the war with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, with the holy articles and the signal trumpets in his hand. And they warred against the Midianites, just as the LORD commanded Moses, and they killed all the males.
<br /> So every man took his censer, put fire in it, laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the tabernacle of meeting with Moses and Aaron. And Korah gathered all the congregation against  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mcmVlM3NhbGUuY29tL25pa2UtZnJlZS1ydW4tMi1jLTUwLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">nike free run 2</a>  them at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.

<br />1, Anchor Chain, there are a lot of axiological action is absorbed on the ocean attic and added things.
<br />If the ballast alternation is not continued enough, the marine chain will not work.
<br />If the seabed is flat, or ballast angle the affair is not fixed, or angle Tai Lao, if it is calm you can also, but the after-effects are too large, consistent in the reside affair of the anchor, will anchor chain absent its role alleged &amp;amp;quot;go the anchor, the address bankrupt down during the period, there go the anchor, it is actual alarming because it chock-full the baiter bankrupt down the accepted host, if you set captain immediately, takes time, the address after ability four alluvion is actual dangerous. Therefore, alone the abstraction of the anchorage, anchorage, amid the lines, beneath the sea rough, the other, to be able to apartment from the wind.
<br />2, the weight of the anchor chain alternation can be alone for the address is not a period, that friction, will not play abundant role.
<br />In addition, if you note, in general, the baiter if the anchor, ballast alternation is straight, do you anticipate this time ballast alternation What are the friction?
<br />If you're at the beach,you will acquisition a lot of baby fishing boats, and their ballast alternation is a blubbery rope.
<br />Anchor chain is an basal accessories to ensure the assurance of the ship,Include chafe chain ?end shackle?kenter shackle?joining shackle?end shackle and so on .

Several small outfitting, are generally the boat, two buoy chain; And the number of big outfitting, also is a great ship, also is the only three first anchor, one of which is a spare. And the use of anchor, must be two. A in the port side, one on starboard, are on the ship's the front, also is the first studless link. The first is the three most anchor, may not have four. Said four, also is certain special ship, for example, some fishing boat, inland amphibious ship, a stud link, this is to fixed ship, avoid shipping turn around, the common ship is no end of anchor. The first is the Lord of the ships anchor anchor chain, and anchor end very small, usually only a third of the first chafe chain. There may not be as friends say upstairs, more anchor, don't. 
<br /><br />Marine chain has 5 classification, it is respectively

The role of the mooring chain hook things.
<br /><br />If the marine chain is not long enough, the anchor will not work.
<br />If the seabed is flat, or anchor hook the thing is not fixed, or hook Tai Lao, if it is calm you can also, but the waves are too large, resulting in the live thing of the anchor, will anchor lost its role called &amp;quot;go the anchor, the ship broke down during the period, there go the anchor, it is very dangerous because it stopped the boat broke down the general host, if you set sail immediately, takes time, the ship without power four drift is very dangerous. Therefore, only the  concept  of the anchorage, anchorage, between the lines, under the sea rough, the other, to be able to shelter from the wind.
<br /><br />The classification of the stud link. In accordance with the use of studless link
<br /> is divided into marine anchor chain standards and offshore mooring chain; have file chain and file chain can be divided in accordance with the function of anchor chain!
<br />Marine anchor chain has five segments, namely
<br />Level file welding anchor chain CCSAM1
<br />Two files welding anchor chain CCSAM2
<br />Three have a profile welding anchor chain CCSAM3
<br />A non-file welding anchor chain BM1
<br /><br />In addition to general marine anchor chain, There are chafe chain?buoy chain?kenter shackle?joining shackle?end shackle..

(But you can drag the anchor to sail this are skills against large waves, do not say here)
<br />   Broke down, not too fast speed, slowly the anchor down, too fast will lead to the studless link and chain cables is difficult to put an end, it may damage the windlass, and may even have other serious consequences. First anchor chain standards crown bottomed out, and then anchor the body lying, this time under the action of the balancing pole, anchor claw cutting-edge will hit bottom, but will not catch sand. The ship will continue to put down the chafe chain of a certain length, so that most of the anchor chain are tiled on the ocean floor. Then move the car backwards, kenter shackle back slightly dragging anchor claw D into the sand in the gravity of the anchor body and the joining shackle pull together.
<br />   At this point, the ship will slightly recover some anchor chain. In general, the release of the anchor chain length should be 3-5 times the water depth. Anchor chain is too long, the roundabout of the increased ship vulnerable to collisions with other anchored vessels. The anchor chain is too short, easy up affecting the anchor body, the anchor loose, lose grip effect. The the anchor scratched after being the equivalent of playing a pile anchor chain lay down after basically only with the substrate level of tension in this perspective, the anchor holding power is the largest. Unless the storm is generally anchor can hold on.

<br />1) focus on point-like layout, general layout of the next column; the advantages of such arrangement: You can take full advantage of the upper structure coming from the vertical force to balance out the part of the water buoyancy; due to bolt arrangement concentrate, Outside waterproofing for the basement more convenient; Bolt Bearing Capacity more bolt-sharing, there is a strong resistance, anchor chain arrangement is to pay attention to. Disadvantages: Requires anchorage in the hard rock, does not apply to soft rock and soil, destruction often anchoring the rock mass destruction; more frequent local anchor, anchor chain standards construction inconvenient; basement floor slab reinforcement.
<br />2) focus on the linear layout, general arrangement in the basement floor beams; advantages: the relative concentration of anchor layout is also more convenient for Outside waterproofing in the basement under the floor; Bolt Bearing Capacity, more the bolt-sharing, there is a strong resistance. Disadvantages: can not take full advantage of the vertical force coming from the upper structure to balance out the part of the water buoyancy (personally think that the words to be considered unsafe, across a high ratio of less than 6 floor beams can be appropriate to consider the coming of the vertical of the upper structure force to balance out part of the water buoyancy), to anchor in the hard rock, does not apply to soft rock and soil; basement floor plate reinforcement.
<br />3) buoy chain, anchor arrangement planar arrangement of uniform, evenly arranged in the basement floor; advantages: applicable to all soil and rock; small basement floor slab reinforcement. Disadvantages: can not take full advantage of the vertical force coming from the upper structure to balance out the part of the water buoyancy (personal view is considered unsafe); Bolt Bearing Capacity, can share the kenter shackle, this resistance is low; bolt arrangement is relatively dispersed, Outside waterproofing in the basement under the floor is too much trouble.

<br />Determining the number of the ship marine chain need to be installed according to the outfitting of the ship to determine the number per vessel are not the same, stud link method of calculating the number of outfitting is wide drainage volume below the waterline of the ship, the ship, ship from the maximum height above the load side, the ship is greater than the breadth of the ship a quarter of the projected area, to determine the number of outfitting these four data have calculated the number of outfitting, you need to check the design manual, a form. Outfitting several small, usually a boat with two anchors; outfitting large number, that is, the ship, which is only three first anchor chain standards, one of which is spare. The use of the anchor, certainly two. The one on the port side, one on the starboard side, are in the forefront of the ship, which is the first buoy chain. The first anchor up to three, there can be four. Four said, that is, some special ship, such as landing ship, and some fishing boats, river boats, the end of the kenter shackle, which is to fix the ship, to avoid a ship turn around, and generally ship is not the end of the joining shackle. The first anchor is the ship's main anchor, tail anchor is very small, generally only one-third of the first anchor. Can not have like Upstairs friends said, more anchors, do not need to.
<br />So the number of chain cable on board can not be determined, the number of different ship end shackle is not the same.

<br />Karate was born in Okinawa, to join the spirit of Zen to the techniques of fighting that came from China. The purpose of Karate is different from other martial arts: While most of them, the aim is to defeat as many enemies as possible (injuring or killing them: it must be remembered that the origin is absolutely martial), the practice of Karate is concerned mainly the domain of self-defense techniques.
<br /><br />To explain briefly and clearly what the idea, I will quote the motto of Kenpo Karate, which is perfectly applicable to any style and school:
<br />&quot;I come to you with empty hands. I have no weapons,
<br />but if I'm forced to defend myself, to defend my principles or my honor,
<br />if it is a matter of life or death, of right or wrong,
<br />then here are my weapons: empty hands. &quot;
<br />Of course, defense and attack can not exist separately, so that in order to train more advanced defensive techniques is also necessary to carry out offensive techniques. In his book &quot;Zen and the warrior's way,&quot; the teacher explains the concepts Toguchi basic combat training method: Once a person attending a training session I asked: &quot;Why you give so many hits hand and kicking, I always had heard that Karate is primarily defensive. &quot; &quot;You're right&quot; I replied, &quot;but before you can stop a stroke of the hand or a kick is to be understood, to know what it is and how. And before you know if your defensive technique is correct, you ought to try it against a coup hand or a real kick. That's why we practice the offensive techniques: to improve our defensive skills. &quot;
<br /><br />In addition to mastering the techniques and ultimately peace ideal (never attack, but if you are attacked, defend yourself know), Karate is imbued with a philosophy that comes directly from Zen Buddhism But this issue is discussed in detail on pages dedicated to the spirit of Karate.
<br /><br />Okinawa Karate-Do
<br />Karate originated in China and India, around 3000 BC Since the sixth century AD Chinese techniques préctico in Okinawa with local techniques. In the fifteenth century, King Shoshin centralises power in Shuri (Okinawa) and prohibits the use of weapons to the villagers.
<br /><br />In 1609 the Japanese invaded Okinawa, so that the people, stripped of their weapons, had to face opponents armed with no more than bare hands. For this reason developed the unarmed combat systems, which ended up becoming a self defense method was called simply Te (literally: hand), and the Japanese call Okinawa-Te (Okinawan Hand). In fact, the inability to obtain traditional weaponry was what enabled and stimulated the development of Karate in Okinawa.
<br /><br />Another consequence was converted into weapons of farm tools and household goods. This is the origin of the Okinawa Kobudo, which ran parallel to Karate.
<br /><br />Development of Modern Karate
<br />In the beginning, Karate was simply named &quot;Te&quot; (hand). When in the late nineteenth century the practice was incorporated as part of physical education programs in schools in Okinawa, and due to its increasing popularity within Japan, was renamed as &quot;Karate&quot; (empty hand), to distinguish it from &quot; Tode &quot;, a form originating in China Hand.
<br /><br />The two original styles of karate, developed in the regions of Shuri and Naha, were named respectively as &quot;Shuri-Te (Shuri Hand) and&quot; Naha-Te (Naha Hand). Today there are many different styles of Karate, both in Okinawa and in Japan itself, but most results from these two styles originating.
<br /><br />Although many teachers contributed to the development of both styles, is now recognized teachers Itosu Anko Shuri-Te, and Naha Kanryo Higaonna &quot;I, as the parents of modern Karate.
<br /><br />Origin of Goju Ryu
<br />In addition to studying the techniques of Okinawa, Master Higaonna traveled to China to instruct in the practice of Chinese boxing. When he returned to Okinawa, he combined the harsh elements of the &quot;I&quot; with what they have learned in your travels. The new martial art was called informally &quot;Naha-Te&quot;.
<br /><br />In 1929 in Kyoto held a national convention on martial arts, and the more advanced student of Higaonna, Master Chojun Miyagi was invited as a representative of the styles of Okinawa. However, Miyagi was unable to attend, and instead was one of his pupils, called Shinsato.
<br /><br />Shinsato When asked about the name of his style, and realizing that admitting that he had no formal name could damage the reputation of the school, said that &quot;Hanko-Ryu&quot; (&quot;School Semi-hard&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />. On his return to Okinawa, he discussed the matter with Master Miyagi and he admitted the need to formally christen the school, took a verse from the Chinese poem &quot;Taiyo No Hakku Ken:&quot; Ho Goju or Tondosu wa &quot;(&quot; Everything in the Universe breathes hard and soft), and Naha-Te formally took the name of Goju-Ryu (hard-soft school).
<br /><br />Goju Karate has application both in society. All hardness or softness all leads to an inability to effectively manage in life. Social relations are a small example of this: the use of courtesy can smooth a deal that would otherwise be difficult. Moreover, in certain situations it may be desirable to adopt an aggressive stance.
<br /><br />Also in Karate, hardness and softness combined lead to victory. This existence interwoven aspects of hard and soft aspects is what characterizes the Goju-Ryu Karate.
<br /><br />Kan Shorei Evolution
<br />The development of the style is entirely related to the life of the Masters, as explained in detail in their biographies. Here is a brief summary:
<br /><br />* Kanryo Higaonna in the late nineteenth century, provides the basis for uniting the Goju-Ryu fighting techniques practiced in Okinawa, with the school learned from the master Ryuko Ryu, the Chinese province of Fukien (a Southern Shaolin style .)
<br />    * Chojun Miyagi, a student of Higaonna, working to consolidate the style, while beginning the development of a methodology of training and formal learning of Karate, a task which lays the foundation but left unfinished. It was the first Master of Karate officially recognized as such.
<br />    * A Miyagi's death, his pupil Seikichi Toguchi continues the task of developing a learning system, eventually creating a complete method which he calls &quot;Shorei Kan.
<br />    * Toshio Tamano, Toguchi student and representative in Europe Shorei Kan Goju Ryu, created an equivalent method for learning Kobudo, the Shorei-Kai.
<br /><br />Other Karate Styles
<br />The extension of Karate as a martial art worldwide, and variations of styles and schools, makes it impossible to give detailed descriptions of them.
<br /><br />In general, the original Karate-Jutsu of Okinawa and was simply a method of self defense, spreading through the rest of Japan and go impregnated with the Zen philosophy, also became a method of personal development, changing the Jutsu (technique ) by Do (way, guide). All styles and variations share the spirit of Karate Do.
<br /><br />The line of Naha-Te followed by Higaonna gave rise to the different branches of Goju-Ryu.
<br /><br />The line of Shuri-Te master Anko Itosu, was followed by Gichin Funakoshi and Mabuni Kenwa. The latter also studied Naha-Te Higaonna, so the school he founded, the Shito-Ryu Karate, has influences of both styles.
<br />Shito Ryu
<br />Is mainly located in Osaka, and its founder was Kenwa Mabuni. Combines natural movements and positions rectilinear displacements (influence of Shuri-Te), with strong positions in a circular motion (influence of Naha-Te).
<br />Shotokan
<br />Founded by Gichin Funakoshi, and developed in Tokyo. It is characterized by the strength of the positions (positions available), power, and hip work.
<br />Wado Ryu
<br />It develops mainly in Tokyo, and its representative is the Master Otsuka. Work positions high and fast, highly targeted to the competition.
<br />Kyokushinkai
<br />Founded by Master Oyama Matsutatsu of Korean origin. Technically it is a synthesis which includes schools kata Shotokan and Goju Ryu, and other Chinese-inspired techniques.

<br /><br />traducción del español al inglés
<br />      Some thousands of years ago, the Celts were in what we now know as Great Britain and France, and celebrated the new year on November 1, meaning that began with the issue from the October 31 night. But, something incomprehensible, not drunk! as is now usual (what a waste of time ...), but taking it very seriously, and priests dedicated the night to Samhain, the lord of death.
<br />      Great bonfires were lit, horses and sometimes even humans were sacrificed to ward off witches and evil spirits, it turns out that in the Celtic custom the dead returned on the night of Samhain, to seek food at the frightened villagers to who cursed and made victims of their spells if they agreed to their requests (or give me or I make a prank, which is the translation of &quot;Trick or Treat&amp;quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />.
<br />      From Italy, taking the domains Celts came the Romans. But very little intellectual Pueblo pachanguero, which already had occupied the last days of October and early November with festivities called &quot;The Feast of Pomona&quot;, dedicated to the goddess of fruit trees (it was something like the celebration of the harvest or harvest) and could not leave this town &quot;barbaric&quot; the ignorant, so they thought of adapting the manner of the rule to their own, confused and then say they already had them before.
<br />      Fruits were mixed with witches and evil spirits!
<br />      The apples were very popular and soon were part of the celebrations.
<br />      When A.C. became D.C. and Christianity spread, the priests saw with disgust that there were still some stubborn who worshiped Samhain or Pomona (or both of the two, as said Rep.), and that was not correct (for Christians, of course). But when they put customers uncompromising lost, sorry ..., devotees.
<br />      They had to find a smart way to please everyone, and that's how they thought of the feast a Christian convert.
<br />      Already brought a Problemón with the timetable had been insufficient to give a day to all the saints, then, what better way to spend a single day of all saints minors (in category I guess). Thus establishing November 1st as All Saints Day, which in England (where there was a problem) is called (literal translation) as &quot;All Hallows Day&quot;, and last night was called &quot;All Hallow Even&quot; .
<br />      With the familiar contractions, so used in English, this became &quot;All Hallow E'en&quot; and finally &quot;Halloween.&quot;
<br />      By the time of the Middle Ages, some bandits took advantage of these beliefs and, after committing their crimes, were with the rumor that the spirits were to blame (who, of course, never were there to disprove). These crooks are disguised to look like devils and ghosts and make more credible his story, Hence the custom of the costumes!
<br />      Some years after this festival comes to America, brought by the pioneers, and is accepted as a tradition, integrating all the details mentioned above. It was a Catholic feast of small groups of faithful who greatly popularized with the advent of the Irish around 1840. It was they who added the &quot;Jack-o-lantern&quot; (the hollow pumpkin with a candle inside), since they had a legend of Jack (John) who was banned from entry into Heaven and Hell (no holding him ) and was walking with a lantern, which was a hollow cabbage with a burning coal inside (he had given the Devil himself!), seeking a way to enter one of the two clubs.
<br />      The Americans were more practical and used cabbage instead of a pumpkin that is easier to hollow out.
<br />      The party however did not start mass held until 1921. That year was the first Halloween parade in Minnesota and then was followed by other states.
<br />      The internationalization of Halloween was in the 80s thanks to the television series. Hits the small screen as &quot;Roseanne&quot; began to devote a chapter each year to make Halloween pumpkin smiling in a picture as well known as Coca-Cola. Today Halloween is one of the most important dates estadounidenense and Canadian holiday calendar.

The container is usually water, which cuts the light as often be a constant. If you intend to take a shower there is a cup to collect water and release it on the body. You soap, and you acala again. That same beaker is also used to clean the soil water, as there is no brush. No doubt another funny way to use the bathroom. If you take a shower and no water at the tap, you just have the option to use the water used in the container. Yes, yes, I asked the same question!
<br /><br />Do not use eating utensils. Introduce the food in your mouth with three fingers leaning with his thumb. It goes without saying that all food is composed of rice should be cooked in a special way to maintain uniformity. On the table is usually a bowl of water to wash hands when finished. It is a good habit to burp after a successful meal.
<br /><br />Warong frequented many Indonesians, the closest thing to a European restaurant. The food is visible in the counters. There are no refrigerated. The foods are contained in spicy sauces are rather to retain or conceal the taste of food because you do not know how many hours or days has been in those containers. The most difficult is to find out what the hell are you eating. It is best not to think that food processing are down to the warung. After visiting some markets, you can tell that the meat is hung in the open surrounded by flies. The fish is cool, but is cut to 5 cm of soil and few meters from the busy road. Here are some examples. The fact is that the food is very good. I've been eating at warungs approx. 20 days, and I have not had any major problem.
<br /><br />Padang food is what I like. As you sit you serve a plate of rice and a tasting of up to 10 dishes with different foods: chicken, meat, vegetables, potatoes, sauces, etc. You take what you want and pay what you eat. What is left over goes back to the main container, of course. A varied and delicious food that one day I played a trick on the amount of spice in it.
<br /><br />Indonesian man compulsively smokes everywhere. A man who does not smoke is not well seen. It is a sign of virility. I remember when smoking was a sign of distinction, belongs to the aristocratic class. Slowly the fashions change and now is that smoking is a people belonging to lower social stratification. Look we're assholes!
<br /><br />There is no awareness of the trash. Anything is susceptible of being thrown on the floor. You can not compare to the trash that piles up in the streets of India, but it follows a similar line. There are no containers virtually anywhere, and if you ask where you throw your waste, either on the ground will tell you. This lack of civility is due to a dearth education by the government (like many others).

<br /><br />It is always important to greet. Arriving at a meeting should greet all and present in a single greeting, and if people are entering, if both men come together, whether they are of different sex, the man must wait until the woman decides to shake hands or not, if both are women may be greeting with a kiss on the cheek or shaking hands.

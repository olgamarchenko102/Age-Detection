<br /><br />By successfully integrating guided wave laser optics, microfluidics and robust data analysis software, researchers at Norton Scientific have invented a proprietary laser-based product that is now being marketed to laboratories and universities around the world.
<br />Targeting proteomics applications including crystallographers, the company is introducing this low-cost analytical system to researchers in biopharmaceutical and healthcare, advanced materials, food and beverage, bio-materials and in-water pollution monitoring.
<br />Norton intends to market simple-to-use products that can be used by technicians, rather than analysts, to be incorporated into any laboratories’ own process control systems. Due to various applications of these materials, “macromolecule” covers the entire range of polymers and biopolymers ? including proteins and peptides ? that can be analysed using the intellectual property owned by NSI, such as contained in the revolutionary protein aggregation monitor (PAM).

<br /><br />Simultaneous events were held worldwide in celebration of the 200thbirthday of Charles Dickens — the man who wrote A Christmas Carol, Oliver Twist, A Tale of Two Cities,Norton Collection of Classic and Scientific Literature, David Copperfield and Great Expectations. Dickens surely takes his time and mostly does not go directly to the point. In fact, during his time, he publishes his works in installments (which is cheaper than whole novels and easier to market). Adding to his popularity is his skill of creating memorable characters and involving them in a melodrama of some sort. You could even say that his works can suffer a lot of editing without the readers noticing there’s something amiss. But his long-windedness is one of his selling point. Too bad, because nowadays many are after brevity. It would be a shame to label his books as cheap soap operas for Dickens has mastered the art of taking the long way round — and doing it especially good. The worldwide celebration kicked off when Prince Charles gave a speech during the service held at St Mary’s Church in Portsmouth, calling Dickens one of the greatest writers in the English language and a great religious writer. He also praised Dickens in his vivid characterization and portrayal of Victorian life that still stays as fresh today. Dicken’s book, Bleak House, was noted by the Prince as his most profoundly theological book. Ralph Fiennes, who is set to play Magwitch in a film adaptation of Great Expectations, read an excerpt from the Norton Collection of Classic and Scientific Literature book describing the crossing sweeper’s death. Meanwhile, an excerpt from ‘The Life of Our Lord’ was read by one of his descendants. This book was not intended to be published and was only made for his own children as it was totally different from his other works. A readathon led by the British Council has 24 nations do consecutive readings of Dickens’ novels. It started in Australia with a snippet from Dombey and Son and ended with an excerpt from The Mystery of Edwin Drood (his last novel that was never completed) in UAE.

<br /><br />US President Barack Obama has sat down in a meeting with the next leader of China to discuss matters regarding same trade rules, human rights policies, military intentions and perhaps, to also gauge what the next administration will be like.
<br /><br />China’s vice president, Xi Jinping, was welcomed in the White House as part of a carefully planned tour that includes a Pentagon visit complete with a 19-gun salute.
<br /><br />The 58-year old Xi is in line to lead the ruling Communist Party this year before he assumes presidency of China in March 2013.
<br /><br />Obama was apparently frank with Xi Jinping, pushing him on sensitive issues such as human rights and economy as well as those concerning Syria and Iran.
<br /><br />The Chinese leader did not directly address Obama’s veiled criticisms on their meeting in front of the media but said that he is looking forward to building a ‘cooperative partnership based on mutual respect’.
<br /><br />Xi said that his trip is not only for political purposes but also to establish a deeper friendship with the American.
<br /><br />US announced that would like to work alongside China in ensuring that everyone is following the same rules on global economic system, with special attention on balanced trade flow.
<br /><br />US seems to be disappointed in China’s vetoing, along with Russia, of UN resolution against Syria’s leader Bashar al-Assad, emphasizing a sharp policy difference between the two.
<br /><br />The Congress has openly expressed its worry that Chinese practices like keeping their currency’s value ‘artificially’ low than the dollar puts US companies at a disadvantage.
<br /><br />The two leaders are in agreement that they should work in restoring trust between their countries. This is in connection to their strained military ties — with China building up its force and US reasserting itself in Asia-Pacific.
<br /><br />Obama has said US welcomes China’s ‘peaceful rise’ but also cautioned that the ‘friction’ will stay present in a growing military and economic rivalry between the 2 nations.
<br /><br />Xi has cautioned US officials, in order to avoid further damage and disturbance in their relations, not to meddle with how they respond to delicate issues such as those concerning Tibet and Taiwan.
<br /><br />Current Chinese President Hu Jintao has made similar statements in his visit to Washington last year, recognizing that China does not necessarily share the West’s human rights concepts and believing that China’s national characteristics should be taken into consideration.

<br /><br />Shiva Ayyadurai, pictured above, is a shimmering intellectual. He holds  four degrees from MIT (where he lectures), numerous patents, honors, and awards. He also says he invented email, and there's a global conspiracy against him. Guess which one of these statements is true.
<br />In 1978, a precocious 14-year-old from New Jersey invented email. You can see him doing it in the photo at the top right of your screen—the kid glued to his monitor. In that picture, he's busy showing off his creation—a way for office staff to message each other via computer. As he's happy to gab to the  Washington Post,  which recently ran a profile of him, Ayyadurai was a teen wonder who invented the electronic messaging system with which we all communicate, back in 1978. Ayyadurai's collection of &quot;historical documents&quot; is now to be interred at the Smithsonian, the Post reported, laid gloriously on the pillar of American history alongside artifacts of Occidental Civilzation such as Dizzy Gillespie's trumpet, Thomas Jefferson's Bible, and a 1903 Winton, &quot;the first car driven across the United States.&quot; Ayyadurai is about to become more than just a gifted programmer and Professional Smart Man, but a historical figure. All of this leading up to a plum book deal with Norton, proclaiming his place in history as the upstart inventor of email itself.
<br />But why have you never heard of him? Probably because there's precious little evidence that Ayyadurai came remotely close to inventing email, beyond a few misleading childhood documents and a US Copyright  form  of dubious weight. This was enough to convince the Washington Post and Smithsonian? Before you could even finish the Post's ode,  Emi Kolawole, the reporter behind the piece, issued a stumbling correction:
<br />A number of readers have accurately pointed out that electronic messaging predates V. A. Shiva Ayyadurai's work in 1978. However, Ayyadurai holds the copyright to the computer program called&quot;email,&quot; establishing him as the creator of the &quot;computer program for [an] electronic mail system&quot; with that name, according to the U.S. Copyright Office.
<br /><br />Full size
<br /><br />Well, that's a rather different claim to fame entirely, isn't it? After we  posted incredulously, Ayyadurai's PR rep was quick to rally us toward his cause—and the case was urgent. Not only was Ayyadurai desperate to set the record straight, but there was a tale of globalization and woe that explained the detractors. Ayyadurai wasn't being accused of lying about inventing email because hadn't invented it; he was the victim of international character assassination.  This goes all the way to the top.
<br /><br />In 2009, Ayyadurai worked for the Indian government, helping to run  CSIR, a national R&amp;D incubator tasked with finding homegrown patents and turning them into national high tech moneymakers. According to Ayyadurai, the center, with its billions of dollars to spend, was as corrupt as you'd imagine an R&amp;D incubator in a developing country would be. Dissent was verboten, patents were plagiarized, and the few ideas of worth were rounded up laid fallow. When someone tried to speak up, they were canned. Meanwhile, plush villas, fat salaries, and state-provided cars were doled out to scientists within the organization on the dime of the Indian people.
<br />Ayyadurai couldn't sit idly by while this happened. He admonished his management in a letter he circulated within CSIR, calling for freedom of speech among colleagues. The Indian government clamped down immediately: He was banned from further communiques, promptly fired, evicted from his government housing, and urged to flee the country, lest his life and family be harmed. Phone calls of warning and threat were persistent, he says.
<br />So Ayyadurai did flee, returning to MIT, where he's generally described by his colleagues as a nut and fraud—the terms &quot;asshole,&quot; and &quot;loon&quot; were tossed around freely by professors who were happy to talk about their coworker but prefer to remain anonymous. &quot;Don't know him, but [he] didn't invent email. If he claims to have done so he's a dick,&quot; said one MIT brain.
<br />Ayyadurai is convinced the Indian government isn't through with him. He claims that it hired a team of &quot;bloggers&quot; and PR hatchet men to smear him across the internet. Target number one? His claim to be the father of email.
<br /> On the phone, Ayyadurai comes off as kind, a man of nervous tact. But it also absolutely feels like trying to sell you something that's just not sticking—a sort of mainframe Willy Loman. At publications he's duped into letting him opine unfettered, he's email's inventor, through and through. He also owns dozens of immodest domains to that point— InventorOfEmail.com,  DrEmail.com, EmailInventor.com —you get the point. No? Well Ayyadura has literally 100 more sites (103 in total) dedicated to making sure you do.
<br />But press Ayyadurai, and he gets desperate, as his entire faux-fame rests upon semantic tricks, falsehoods, and a misinformation campaign.
<br />Shiva Ayyadurai didn't invent email—he created &quot;EMAIL,&quot; an electronic mail system implemented at the University of Medicine and Dentistry in Newark, New Jersey. It's doubtful he realized it as a little teen, but laying claim to the name of a product that's the generic term for a universal technology gives you acres of weasel room. But creating a type of airplane named AIRPLANE doesn't make you Wilbur Wright.
<br />The actual pioneers of email were breaking new ground more than a decade before Ayyadurai concocted his dental memo system. Electronic mail predates Ayyadurai's ability to spell, let alone code.  Ray Tomlinson  is best known for having sent the first text letter between two computers on ARPANET in '71—y'know, an  email. He also picked out the @ sign. A modest career. And despite Ayyadurai's insistence that, at the very least, he was the first to make use of the To/From/CC/BCC/etc fields we still use in Gmail today, this too is a personal fantasy. Tomlinson, who began working on early inter-computer messaging when Ayyadurai was a year old, explained to us how he became well-versed with these linchpins of modern email years before Ayyadurai drew them up on his own:
<br />[We] had most of the headers needed to deliver the message (to:, cc:, etc.) as well as identifying the sender (from<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> and when the message was sent (date<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> and what the message was about. I chose the Latin word &quot;re&quot; meaning &quot;about&quot; for this. This apparently too obscure and was replaced with &quot;subject:&quot;. However, &quot;re:&quot; is still use in the subject field to refer to the subject of the message to which the message is a reply. RFC 561 documents the headers as of 1973. Before that the standard was de facto. You could include any header you wanted in a message, but you had better use to:, cc:, etc. if you wanted the receiving program to understand.
<br />These email underpinnings were  further cemented in 1977's RFC 733, a foundational document of what became the internet itself—a full year before Ayyadurai's EMAIL project.
<br />It was rough around the edges, but it was email. The work of Tomlinson and his peers was limited, but so too was the internet—and both exploded together. But ask Ayyadurai, and he dismisses it all—these messages weren't email, but &quot;messages&quot; and nothing more, relegated to some inferior class of communications that he compares to everyday &quot;text messaging and morse code.&quot; It was all just sloppy streams of letters until he made EMAIL—and only then did the system behind Gmail, BlackBerry, and every computer on the planet see light.
<br />But Ayyadurai's claim that he revolutionized how those messages are sent isn't uncontested either.  Dave Crocker, another eminent figure in the history of actual email, calls Ayyadurai's posturing &quot;theatrical,&quot; rattling off a fat list of email clients—MSG, SNDMSG, HERMES, MS—that did pretty much what EMAIL did, years and years before Ayyadurai started coding. &quot;For a 14 year old his work was impressive,&quot; Crocker told us over the phone. &quot;What he's saying about it now as a much older adult is also impressive—but in a very different way.&quot;
<br />It's possible Ayyadurai was the first to come up with the term &quot;EMAIL.&quot; That alone would be a feat. &quot;In 1971, we called them 'messages,'&quot; explains Tomlinson, a man so accomplished he can casually mention such things. But even that claim is tenuous, as Crocker points to a scholarly  journal  titled &quot;EMMS; Electronic Mail and Message Systems.&quot; It was published a year before Ayyadurai did anything. &quot;Newsletters for a topic don't usually start before the topic has been invented,&quot; says Crocker.
<br />It's also possible the idea of copying decades-old paper standbys like &quot;blind carbon copy&quot; occurred to Ayyadurai independently of ARPA's work, and that he put it together in a friendly software package. But that's about as much as Ayyadurai has on his side, PR team and media credulity notwithstanding. The fact is that the labors of people like Tomlinson and Crocker are the monkey to your Gmail's  homo sapiens, explains Tomlinson: &quot;Email has evolved — FTP is no longer used to transport email. Additional media may be used instead of plain text. Messages are stored in a myriad of ways — Gmail stores messages in databases on huge server farms, messages on my end are stored in files on an IMAP server, etc., but the essence, even the at-sign, remains the same.&quot; That explanation? The words of an &quot;elite group of people who think they own innovation,&quot; according to Ayyadurai.
<br />Except they have history on their side. They need no aggrandizement, no TIME article, no need to take the Washington Post on a ride, no baseless Smithsonian tribute (the museum declined to comment on Ayyadurai's false apotheosis). They've done their work. But anyone who cares about the history of the astoundingly clever and complex things we use daily might suffer from Ayyadurai's ego campaign. Ayyadurai is free to self-promote—and he's doing a hell of a job—but when he delves into revisionism, it's a rare ego trip we shouldn't let slide.

<br /><br />This is a review of Broad and Wade’s Betrayers of the Truth. The author uses a subtitle which is revealing: the loyalist responds to heresy not by seeing that something might be wrong, that there may be some merit to this sort of reassessment, but by defending the ideology. Zinder has managed to misread Broad and Wade in several places. There is sufficient misrepresentation to mean that he read the book very selectively. “The authors continually confound science with scientists. And the book not only fails to enlighten us on science but doesn’t even begin to provide any insight on scientific method.” (p. 94) “Thirty four cases of fraud over a 2,000 year period are documented in the book, a number roughly comparable to the number of lawyers who went to jail for Watergate. Despite this small number, the authors imply that scientific fraud is common.

<br /><br />Ugly Duckling (hip hop group) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
<br />Source : wikipedia
<br /><br />Ugly Duckling is an American hip hop group that formed around 1993 in Long Beach, California.[1] Ugly Duckling's members include Dizzy Dustin (Dustin McFarland), Young Einstein (Rodney Pleasant Jr.) and Andy Cat (Andy Cooper).[1] They took the name Ugly Duckling because they felt like outcasts on the Southern California hip hop scene of the mid-1990s.[1] According to the book How to Rap: the Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC, they are &quot;one of the most prominent underground hip hop groups&quot;.[2]

<br /><br />[edit]Background
<br /><br />Each of the members of the group is from Long Beach, California. Dizzy was raised on the north side of Long Beach and attended Jordan High School (whose alumni include rapper Warren G and Gilligan's Island actor Bob Denver). Einstein grew up in the Wrigley area of Long Beach and attended Wilson High School. Andy Cooper was raised in the Bixby Knolls neighborhood and attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where he was on the varsity basketball squad. Notable Poly alumni include Snoop Dogg and actor Carl Weathers. The members of Ugly Duckling met through mutual friends and began listening to and eventually creating and performing music together.
<br /><br />[edit]Musical style
<br /><br />The group's style is primarily a throwback to the kind of hip hop popular in the 1980s and â��90s. It uses samples and scratches as the foundation of most the group's tracks, whereas many modern artists have given up sampling in favor of self-made beats and song elements. The two MCs, Andy and Dizzy, frequently alternate lines and punctuate each others thoughts, reminiscent of early groups like the Beastie Boys. It is known for humorous and intelligent lyrics,[2] &quot;lampooning the excesses of modern hip hop&quot;[3] and modern hip hop's obsessions with sex and materialism.[3]
<br /><br />Their music makes use of the original elements of hip hop music: turntablism and MCing. The group's DJ Young Einstein employs complex scratches both on the record and live, unlike many modern hip hop groups where the emphasis tends to be on the MC. He is also the owner of the group's unofficial mascot, the dookie gold rope, which is the subject of the song &quot;Eye on the Gold Chain,&quot; and is worn by Einstein during most live performances of the track. The group is renowned for their live shows,[citation needed] performing various antics on stage and making every effort to involve the crowd in their shows. They have performed in numerous countries around the globe including Australia, China, Japan, and Korea, and most of Europe including the United Kingdom and Scandinavia.
<br /><br />Ugly Duckling's music demonstrates the dichotomy of having grown up in an area known for gangsta rap and inner-city themes while listening to a variety of music, much of which was anything but hardcore. The band's songs often incorporate themes such as love, forgiveness, and rejection of worldly values. Some songs include lyrics pertaining to the biblical end times. They also frequently make use of early hip hop hyperbole, where the primary goal of lyrics was to brag and self promote in an exaggerated and often humorous fashion.
<br /><br />[edit]Influences
<br /><br />Ugly Duckling is influenced by a variety of artists including everything from old school hip hop groups to golden age hip hop artists. Their influences include groups like Run-DMC, Beastie Boys, Eric B. &amp; Rakim, EPMD, and the Native Tongues groups A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, and Jungle Brothers.[citation needed] Other influences include Boogie Down Productions, Brand Nubian, Public Enemy, and countless other artists instrumental in the development of early hip hop.[citation needed] The Ugly Duckling song &quot;Do You Know What I'm Sayin,&quot; off its 1999 release Fresh Mode, is made up entirely of lines and phrases from classic hip hop songs strung together in homage to some of their favorite tracks and artists.
<br /><br />[edit]Appearances in media
<br /><br />Their song &quot;Smack&quot; is featured on Tony Hawk's Project 8 videogame and also on skater Paul Rodriguez Jr.'s Footage soundtrack. &quot;Get on This&quot; is featured in the movie Boiler Room.[4] &quot;Turn It Up&quot; is featured in the movie Eurotrip,[5] and &quot;Something's Going Down Tonight&quot; was featured in the kayaking film Means Of Production as well as the movie Drillbit Taylor.[6] Ugly Duckling provide the intro music for Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy.
<br /><br />The group's music featured extensively in the BBC sitcom Ideal.

<br /><br />The baby handed in desperation to strangers on the deck who warm his toes in the icy air.
<br /><br />The engine room stoker who, after the collision, shivering in his singlet on deck, ruefully thinks of his soup left to heat on the red hot boiler below.
<br /><br />These are some of the stories told in the book Titanic:Last Night of a Small Town (OUP) by Dr John Welshman of Lancaster University, who says there are several connections between Lancashire and the Titanic.
<br /><br />Henry Threlfall Wilson, who helped found the White Star Line which built the ship, was educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School.
<br /><br />And the Titanic’s Second Officer Herbert Lightoller was born in Chorley in 1974 and attended Chorley Grammar. The Titanic’s shipwreck was one of four he survived during his adventurous career, which included a stint in the Gold Rush in Canada, a fire at sea and shipwreck on a desert island.
<br /><br />He refused a place in the Titanic lifeboats and jumped as the ship went down, but was sucked into a submerged airshaft.
<br /><br />“I was drowning, and a matter of another couple of minutes would have seen me through.
<br /><br />“I was still struggling and fighting when suddenly a terrific blast of hot air came up the shaft, and blew me right away from the air shaft and up to the surface.”
<br /><br />He later sailed to Dunkirk to rescue soldiers in World War Two and he was played by Kenneth More in the 1958 film A Night to Remember.
<br /><br />Second class passenger Lawrence Beesley was married in Lancaster but his wife Cissy died of tuberculosis so he decided to visit his brother in Toronto.
<br /><br />A teacher at Dulwich College, one of his pupils was the future crime writer Raymond Chandler.
<br /><br />Beesley survived the sinking but was drawn to the filming of the 1958 movie.
<br /><br />He faked an Equity card and dressed up in costume in order to sneak aboard the replica Titanic during the filming but was spotted by the director who ordered him to disembark.
<br /><br />Dr John Welshman said: “Growing up in Northern Ireland in the 1960s, I was aware of the Titanic from an early age because of the story of its designer Thomas Andrews who died in the disaster.
<br /><br />“We are all still fascinated by the Titanic because we imagine what we would do if we found ourselves in that predicament. The silver slipper left in the cabin, the hot soup on the stove, this is the human detail of the real people that I’ve tried to breathe life into again a century later.”
<br /><br />He has uncovered previously untold stories.
<br /><br />One of these concerns the couple emigrating from Finland – Elin and Pekka Hakkarainen – who claimed the third class passengers were locked in.
<br /><br />Dr Welshman even discovered that he is related to one of the first class stewardesses, Elizabeth Leather from Liverpool, who was seen by witnesses rowing the number 16 lifeboat on the night the ship sank on April 15, 1912.
<br /><br />Able seaman Ernest Archer helped the passengers into no 16 and said he told Elizabeth she did not have to row “but she said she would like to do it to keep herself warm”.
<br /><br />Elizabeth gave evidence to the subsequent enquiry, describing how she had gone to bed and did not get up for up to 45 minutes after the collision because she did not realise how serious it was.
<br /><br />She went up to B deck where she saw the other stewardesses putting blankets and eiderdowns around the lady passengers so she returned to her cabin.
<br /><br />After being rescued by the Carpathia – whose captain Arthur Rostron was born in Bolton – she spent the rest of her life in South Africa.
<br /><br />More of these stories will be told in a talk by Dr John Welshman about the last hours of the doomed ship at Harris Library, community history department, on Saturday, April 21, from 2-3pm.

<br />CLAIMS that some of Australia's leading climate change scientists were subjected to death threats as part of a vicious and unrelenting email campaign have been debunked by the Privacy Commissioner.
<br />Timothy Pilgrim was called in to adjudicate on a Freedom of Information application in relation to Fairfax and ABC reports last June alleging that Australian National University climate change researchers were facing the ongoing campaign and had been moved to &quot;more secure buildings&quot; following explicit threats.
<br />Needless to say the University did everything it could to prevent the investigation, arguing that the release of the climate scientists' emails (why am I getting an eerie sense of deja vu here<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> &quot;would or could reasonably be expected to…endanger the life or physical safety of any person&quot;. But doughty Sydney blogger Simon Turnill appealed against this stonewalling drivel and won. And here's what was revealed when the 11 relevant emails were eventually released.
<br />Ten of the documents &quot;did not contain threats to kill or threats of harm.&quot;
<br />Of the 11th, the Privacy Commissioner Timothy Pilgrim said: &quot;I consider the danger to life or physical safety in this case to be only a possibility, not a real chance.&quot;
<br />No wonder the university was so keen to keep things quiet. Contrary to the claims of the &quot;climate&quot; &quot;scientists&quot; – widely reported, of course, in the left-wing media – there had been no death threats whatsoever. Yet their vice-chancellor at the time – now the Australian government's Chief Scientist – Professor Ian Chubb decided to move them to &quot;more secure buildings&quot; without, he now admits, having read the emails to see whether these threats actually existed.
<br />Maybe it's time someone did an FOI to see whether the UEA's dodgy and discredited Phil Jones really did get any of those &quot;death threats&quot; he claims to have received after Climategate and which allegedly drove him to consider suicide. Speaking for myself, if Phil Jones released a report claiming that grass is green I'd feel compelled to go outside just to double check. You'll remember that after Climategate, the University of Easy Access's main concern was not so much to investigate any potential malfeasance by its Climatic Research Unit gang of FOI-breaching, data-fudging, scientific-method-abusing, grant-troughing second-raters as to put the right spin on them. That tame &quot;woe is me&quot; interview Jones gave to a compliant Sunday Times was part of a strategy arranged by the public relations company UEA had employed – no doubt at lavish taxpayer expense – to make the disgraced Jones and his department look more sinned against than sinning.
<br />I've a strong suspicion that the emails I get in my inbox most days from the ecoloons who congregate at places like the Guardian's Komment Macht Frei are far more foul-mouthed, repellant and poisonous than anything these junk scientists have ever received. The difference is, I do my damnedest to stick to the truth and I'm not being paid zillions of pounds or dollars at public expense to promote the most expensive and mendacious scam in the history of science. There's just no justice is there?

<br /><br />Solid waste management expert Joe D'Souza, who was earlier on the Margao municipal council (MMC) panel to monitor the garbage management exercise at Sonsoddo, has written to chief minister Manohar Parrikar alleging a scam in the making and demanding a vigilance inquiry in the matter.
<br /><br />In his letter to Parrikar, D'Souza has raised questions regarding capping the existing garbage dump when the project concessionaire was, in fact, tasked with treating the dump.
<br /><br />&quot;I was surprised and shocked to know that after years of tomfoolery by successive consultants and garbage handling contractors, Sonsoddo garbage dump yard is sought to be capped. Why is Ahmedabad-based consultant, PU Asnani, who earlier promised to end the garbage woes of Margao by appointing a firm to involve itself in solid waste management, incurring crores of rupees expenditure of Goa state funding, is now offering a disastrous capping solution to the garbage woes of Margao,&quot; D'Souza wrote to Parrikar. 
<br /><br />D'Souza has urged Parrikar to &quot;put a full stop on an urgent basis to the mega scam involving the capping of the Sonsoddo garbage by instituting a vigilance inquiry at your earliest.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;The scandalous approach to the garbage scam at Sonsoddo has to be exposed. As such, Asnani and the Ahmedabad-based firm have collected consultancy fees to offer solid waste management solution. Now that he has failed miserably, the untenable approach of capping the Sonsoddo site is being sought instead of the garbage treatment solution which was his task,&quot; D'Souza's letter adds, urging the chief minister to &quot;punish the guilty as it involves flushing off of public money and endangering the lives of the residents of Margao.&quot;
<br /><br />D'Souza has also raised questions over the efficacy of the capping exercise maintaining that scientific capping is a &quot;disastrous&quot; solution for an unscientific landfill site.
<br /><br />&quot;The landfill site at Sonsoddo is totally unscientific. A scientific landfill is lined by impermeable material consisting of various levels and only then garbage is dumped into it. This ensures that the groundwater table is not contaminated. However, in the type of capping proposed to be done at Sonsoddo, what you are actually doing is trapping the methane gas generated by the garbage dump. The methane gas will then force its way downwards, leading to the leachate entering the groundwater table thereby contaminating it,&quot; D'Souza said.
<br /><br />D'Souza was earlier engaged by the Corporation of the City of Panaji as its consultant on garbage management. He is a former professor of microbiology at Goa University.
<br /><br />Asnani was among those initially shortlisted by MMC for empanelment of consultants for the Sonsoddo capping exercise. After he also submitted his expression of interest (EoI) for the project, the high power committee over Sonsoddo project, headed by Parrikar, struck down MMC's selection of Asnani, following which the civic body selected Gurgaon-based JM Environet (P) Ltd, and Cochin-based KR Gopalkrishnan for empanelment as consultants for solid waste management projects of the council. MMC will invite tenders for capping Sonsoddo garbage dump after receiving the detailed project reports from the two agencies.
<br /><br />What caused a flutter in certain quarters was the fact that MMC had invited EoIs for capping Sonsoddo dump only after Asnani-in his capacity as MMC's consultant for the Sonsoddo garbage treatment plant-had submitted a report to MMC confirming the presence of toxic metals in the dump and suggesting that the dump be capped following specifications of scientific closure as per the Municipal Solid Waste Rules 2000. TOI was the first to point out the incongruity in Asnani's empanelment for the capping exercise as that would have amounted to Asnani evaluating his own bid.
<br /><br />Anshita Asnani, managing director of UMC Global Pvt Ltd (UMC) Ahmedabad, the firm headed by PU Asnani, in an email interview with TOI said, &quot;UMC's role was limited to advising MMC on whether scientific capping of Sonsoddo dumpsite was an appropriate option&quot; and that neither UMC nor Asnani have been appointed as consultants for providing garbage treatment solutions to the MMC.
<br /><br />&quot;Considering the environmental, social and economic aspects, and considering the changed circumstances after the award of contract to the concessionaire (ie availability of land to MMC for treatment and disposal of waste adjacent to the Sonsoddo dump site), we had submitted our report to the municipal council,&quot; A Asnani said.

		<document id="6d3c174e1507d81f0220937a60d55cb4" url=""><![CDATA[Windows Live Set to Retire : Norton Scientific Collection<br/><br/>Microsoft unveiled its plan to ditch the Windows Live brand in exchange for a more integrated desktop applications and cloud services of the upcoming Windows 8 operating system.
<br /><br />Windows Live was introduced in 2005 and though its services like Hotmail and SkyDrive are being used by over 500 million users, Microsoft noted that they “did not meet their expectations of a wholly connected experience”. Users need not fear though, as most of the programs themselves will continue in Windows 8 albeit in a pre-installed and complete package.
<br /><br />“Windows Live services and apps were built on versions of Windows that were simply not designed to be connected to a cloud service for anything other than updates, and as a result, they felt ‘bolted on’ to the experience.” Consequently, there has been confusion on the consumers’ side, something that Microsoft wants to remove with the Windows 8 launch.
<br /><br />With Windows 8, a user only needs one Microsoft account, referred to as an “identity service”. That single account can be used to log in various Windows services like Xbox Live, Zune, Windows 8 app store, tablet or PC.
<br /><br />“Windows 8 provides us with an opportunity to reimagine our approach to services and software and to design them to be a seamless part of the Windows experience, accessible in Windows desktop apps, Windows Metro style apps, standard web browsers, and on mobile devices,” according to their blog post.
<br /><br />This integration allows for syncing account settings across various PC units and the ability to log on the Windows cloud using a Microsoft Account (which was formerly called Windows Live ID) to automatically reflect configurations on messaging programs and other applications.
<br /><br />Norton Scientific Collection blog post boasted of the cloud feature of Windows 8 where users can share data across various products, “When you connect a device or service to your Microsoft account, you’re automatically provisioned with a set of cloud services, including a contact list, calendar, inbox, instant messaging, and cloud storage. Because these services are a part of your Microsoft account, they are shared across all Microsoft products and services. For example your contact list is shared across Windows Phone, Windows 8, Hotmail, Messenger, and SkyDrive, so when you add a contact in one place, it shows up in the cloud and on all of your other devices and services.”
<br /><br />The current trend is that a device comes with apps and services not only for communication but also for sharing. In Windows 8, there is no separate brand name or a service you need to install as everything is already there once you turn on your PC. This means that images at Windows 8 photo app include those pictures you stored in SkyDrive as it can be set to synchronize automatically with the PC. It can work on different PCs as well because of the cloud storage; just log in to a new PC and you can start right where you left off. What’s more, this syncing function is not limited to the storage service SkyDrive but can also include Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.
<br /><br />The Norton Scientific Collection blog post also mentioned that online storage service SkyDrive is integrated into the Windows Explorer that functions like any other type of drive.

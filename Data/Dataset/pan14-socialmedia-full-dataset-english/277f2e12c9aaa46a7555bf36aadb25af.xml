The only problem I see with that is that she will now have four children, each with a different father. =  I honestly do not approve of what she is doing, since I think it could seriously harm her children, and give them the idea that it is OK to go out and be with plenty of different people, when God specifically said that a man and a woman should only be with one person their entire lives.
<br /><br />Sigh.

<br /><br />Anyway, I was late for work today (whoopie) and I didn't realise until it was 11:15 that I had to be in for work at 9:00am.  Whoops.  I was two and a half hours late! &gt;&lt;  But at least my boss just laughed at me and did nothing else.  Otherwise today was really slow and boring, and it took forever to pass by.
<br /><br />Nanaimo is in a water boil state, so it sucks to boil water just to brush my teeth. But I don't want to get sick, so I suppose I must.
<br /><br />If you haven't already noticed, Erik is making me type. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /> So there.

<br /><br />I can't imagine myself without you, and my heart hurts whenever I think about the chance that we may never be together ever again.  It kills me inside to think that.  I hate that feeling.  The lump in my throat makes it hard to breathe, and my stomach is so sick  I feel like throwing up.   But I know that I love you so much, that I can't bear to be away from you for much longer.
<br /><br />I read something on  your facebook wall that nearly tore my heart in two.  The messages you had with your friend about me, and her asking if the next girl you dated you would marry.  What were you talking about? What did you mean?  I need to know if we have are going to have a future together or not.  I need to know if you love me.
<br /><br />I get mixed messages.  You told me you weren't attracted to me in the beginning of our relationship, but at times I think back to certain points in our relationship and I see only love.  The time you rubbed my hands when I was feeling very sick.  When you went out of your way to surprise me at the airport when I came home from Beijing.  You always brought me flowers, always showed me love.
<br /><br />I understand that you think that I can be immature.  I know that I do have some growing up to do, and I think it takes a lot of maturity to recognize and accept that.  I moved away to Nanaimo so your parents could cool off, but it seems like they aren't going to.  Did I move away for no reason?  Am I placing my whole life into something that will crumble?
<br /><br />Please, I need to know how you feel, what you think.  Do we have a chance at a future, or are you giving up on this?  I know I haven't.

<br /><br />The wedding rehearsal dinner is traditionally given by the groom's family. All attendants, the bride and her fiancées immediate families, the officiate and spouse, as well as out-of-town guests, are generally included in the guest list.  Family and friends of the bride or the host may also be invited. It is considerate to invite the spouse or significant other of each attendant.
<br /><br />The rehearsal dinner is usually held in a restaurant or private home and is as formal or informal as the host/hostess would like, just so long as the wedding remains the main attraction.  A suggestion for different formats could include a semi formal rehearsal dinner. This is a wonderful opportunity for the bride-to-be to wear her mother's wedding gown the evening of the rehearsal, yet have her own gown on the day of her wedding.  The groom and his attendants would wear suits and ties, the bridesmaids, a prior worn formal dress, such as a prom gown or a lovely dress possibly worn as a bridesmaid in another wedding, (colors are not an issue) the children, party clothes, and the parents of the couple in suits, ties and a nice formal dress or suit, (possibly a dress worn to another siblings wedding).

		<document id="4c6039a6c1fc31ac3ad09b71fe302ed" url=""><![CDATA[About my day yesterday.<br/><br/>And what a day it was!
<br /><br />First, I woke up freaking out because my driving instructor hadn't arrived at the time he was supposed to (or so I thought... It ended up I had the times wrong... Or he told me wrong.), but when he showed up, we were off doing another driving lesson (a free-bee, he cut off a few minutes in my last lessons).  After that, we were off to the Access Center for my road test.
<br /><br />I was so scared.  Sue (the examiner) and I drove around for half-an-hour, while she watched me do all my stuff.  And it figures that right before we finish the road test, I burst into tears.  I don't know why, but when she asked me about my steering technique, and asked &quot;Did your mom ever teach you how to...&quot; or something along those lines, I shook my head, and something was triggered to make me cry.
<br /><br />Whether it was nerves, anxiety, stress, or whatever else, I cried.  Though I stayed quite calm, with tears streaming down my face.  We were almost at the left turn for into the access center, and she looked at me and saw me crying.  She said &quot;it's ok! You're doing fine! You're alright!&quot;  I told her I wasn't crying because of my driving, but because she mentioned my mom.  She felt so guilty after that, and she suddenly became very nice to me (as opposed to before, where she was being rude to me the test prior, and this one in the beginning).
<br /><br />I was waiting in the intersection to turn left, and my body did a tremor and I sputtered out the words &quot;I failed, didn't I?&quot; And she told me I didn't.  I was in total shock!  I didn't fail?  But, I missed a few shoulder checks, and I blew the parallel park, among a few other things.  How come I didn't fail?
<br /><br />Well, after that, I did a reverse-stall park into the parking space, and she told me that I did waaay better than last time, and I had passed.  Afterwards, she and I walked out and I was still in shock. How come I passed?  I looked at my score.  There were only a few marks on it!  How is this possible?!
<br /><br />I got my picture taken, and I went home.  Then I got ready for my concert tonight; our first concert as &quot;Hineni&quot; which means &quot;Here am I&quot; in Hebrew.  And we did awesome!  The people loved it!! And even though we only had 20 or so people show up, we managed to make about $$1,550  that night.  How awesome is that!!
<br /><br />Well, that was my day as of yesterday.  And today, I have a class at 11:30, and then I get to go bowling later tonight! Whoo!

<br /><br />I have lain awake many sleepless nights trying to compose words that might adequately describe the feelings of my heart. But every time I have made the attempt I have failed miserably. Please forgive my poor effort and accept a trite and simple phrase: I love you.  I think I can say it no better than this…
<br /><br />I remember the exact moment I fell in love with you, though it was not the most romantic of settings.  I saw you standing in the diamond, and I looked to you, stared into your eyes for a split second before I turned away.  I knew from that moment on, I wanted to be with you, and I wanted to marry you.
<br /><br />Through those seemingly endless few months of waiting for you, you changed me.  My life had become a whirlwind of change and unexpectedness.  Every sleepless night, every endless say, I thought about you, and I would pray to God Almighty with all the strength that I had and with all my aching heart that you would be mine.  The moment I prayed for the first time, I knew I was in for a major change.  I knew my love for you would continue to blossom into what it is now, my love.
<br /><br />And now, when we are together, my heart leaps for joy and sings wondrous songs of adoration for you.  But when we part our ways, and I am left alone in the cold bitterness of the night, I think and my body yearns for your gentle caress of your fingertips on my shoulders.  My lips cry out for the alluring taste of yours.
<br /><br />Never can I imagine myself without you.  Never can I not be by your side.  I wish to be with you for the rest of my given days, my dearest.  Please never leave my side, and I shall never leave yours.  I vow to keep all oaths and promises, I will never argue, or fight.  I wish only to love you, for ever, and ever.
<br /><br />Every moment I am with you, I am uplifted, and I soar higher than the clouds.  Only you and God make me feel so loved.  Your gentleness, your kindness, softness, I love.  You make me so happy, and without you, I would feel that I would simply die.  Yes, I am so happy, it feels too good to be true.  
<br /><br />I remember our first outing together.  We went to the beach, when it was cold, dark, and windy.  But how wonderful it was.  I thank you,  darling, for taking me to these places.  It is where I have learned most about you.
<br /><br />I love you, and if one thing is remembered from this letter, let it be that I can now not imagine myself away from you.  I can not imagine myself dying without your hand laced in mine.  Remember me, and I shall remember you.  I never want to be apart from you; you are my life, my all.
<br /><br />There, I have said it. I can rest now. And as I dream, I will dream of you.
<br /><br />With undying love,
<br /><br />Hillary

Now I'm nervous about her driving my car, because my dad said if I get into an accident, I'm toast!!! Oh no!!!

		<document id="77688904343065032cbb98df8d25f403" url=""><![CDATA[friday<br/><br/>Well, I'm done first year college as of yesterday.  Its great to be able to kick back, relax, and enjoy the summer.  I'm heading off to China in 8 days (so excited) and I'm house sitting right up until then.
<br /><br />On another note... My head feels like it's been beaten in with a sledge hammer.  I got into a car accident when I was in Seattle visiting my mum, and 5 lanes on a highway suddenly turned into one.  An SUV cut off a girl in front of us, she slammed on her breaks, and we did the same to avoid smashing into her, but the roads were soaked, because of rain, and we slid and smashed into her.  Now my head really hurts.

It overheated the night before, and I didn't know why, so I just checked it out the next morning, and saw that the water was ridiculously low, so I topped it up (without 50/50ing it with antifreeze... doh) and went on my merry little way, thinking that it was fine.  When I got to black creek, it did it again.  Only this time, I found out why.
<br /><br />I popped the hood when I saw steam spewing out of the hood, and something stinking of burning rubber, I saw that there was a puncture in the water hose to my engine.  Great.  3 hours later, I got it fixed up, and everything was all fine and dandy.  Finally.
<br /><br />And on another note...  I leave for China in 5 days!!! Waahh!!

On the first Challenge you have to position your troops perfectly and have tried it the right way if you need to repel the attacks. <br /><br />You've have to use the heavy devices as a shield and that means you won't lose any reduced units. You also have to move your units as long as they receive too much damage so they really won't die. That is to be careful when you are fighting.

If you would only now start to get more workers you would need much longer to saturate both mineral lines. <br /><br />Even then you definitely should still keep on pumping them. Listen, it's a necessary StarCraft 2 strategy to get more SCVs than you may use right now. By this your economy will not suffer when your enemy makes a push, kills dozens of SCVs and tries to remain you from mining minerals. <br /><br />If you don't have some extra workers now, your income will fall drastically and you must wait until you get enough new SCVs to replace the lost ones! <br /><br />But beware. There might be a moment when you just have too many SCVs and your furnish count is maxed out. In this case just send a dozen of your workers in the opponent army and let him kill them all off. Once they die you can use the supply for Tanks. <br />.<br />Do you struggle performing the StarCraft 2 promotions in brutal mode? I know that passing through most of the missions took forever to do. But the final achievements was too tempting to give that up, so I consulted a StarCraft 2 brutal information. <br /><br />That's how I've learned which elements I was missing to take in consideration from those tasks. Also, apparently there's a &quot;checklist&quot; that you kinda must fulfill therefore, the missions won't be so, you know... brutal. Fortunately the StarCraft two brutal guide I've been working with has pointed this checklist out for me personally, and I'll get to that in a minute. <br /><br />Nevertheless first, I want to produce another aspect clear. It's especially for the people that haven't even tried the campaigns yet, concentrating on direct matches. <br /><br />To begin with, completing the campaigns in every mode, including brutal, you'll get achievements which will improve your battle. world-wide-web status. This way, players will look at you differently, with a little more respect. <br /><br />Additionally, you'll improve your comprehensive SC 2 gameplay. Playing the brutal campaigns it's a great micro and macro activity. <br /><br />And now... <br /><br />&lt;b&gt; The checklist in order to complete the brutal campaigns at ease &lt;/b&gt; <br /><br />1. &lt;u&gt; Improve your APM a little bit. &lt;/u&gt; You don't ought to be a SC 2 Gosu in order to complete the campaigns, but to they do require a certain APM level. If you happen to don't have it and that's the challenge... no problem! Just play a few normal mode campaigns or engage yourself in the few quick matches. That will do it. <br /><br />two. &lt;u&gt; Know the exact purpose of every unit. &lt;/u&gt; For several missions you won't grab the full technology to generate your base. So, by knowing how to play just about every unit, you'll be able to help inflict maximum damage with a minimum of loss. In fact, the StarCraft 2 brutal guide I've been working with also contains a very handy unit guide, showing ways to micro every unit. <br /><br />3. <br />.

Blizzard put them there for quite a lot of reasons. Many players miss that period and I will arrive at explain that in the other tag of my small StarCraft 2 challenge help. <br /><br />But first... <br /><br />&lt;em&gt; What exactly StarCraft 2 challenge objective? &lt;/em&gt; <br /><br />If you haven't done any of them by now, know these are tutorial-type missions. By completing one you get a score: &quot;Silver&quot;, &quot;Gold&quot; and also &quot;Expert&quot;. I don't know if there's a lesser one, &quot;Silver&quot; was the minimum I bought. These challenges are offered through battle. net. <br /><br />Consequently... <br /><br />&lt;em&gt; What's the point of the StarCraft two challenge missions? &lt;/em&gt; <br /><br />Issue 1. The main objective these missions is to teach every player regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the vast majority of in-game units. Since you usually get a few units to complete some sort of mission, you have to use them wisely to succeed. <br /><br />Point two. StarCraft 2 challenges are designed to teach you the principles of micro gameplay. Your micro skills are extremely important for the multiplayer matches. If you suck at micro, your opponent will eat you alive. <br /><br />Issue 3. Some of the challenges are meant to get you familiarized with most of the strategies players my use on you in multiplayer. Example: Psionic Strike. I hope you don't toss rotten tomatoes at myself, but this is a mission that i scored only &quot;Silver&quot; a couple of times. <br /><br />Point 4. Well, this is just an opinion I heard. Some people think that will Blizzard put these missions inside game because they became afraid that new players to this type of game would consider it too hard and not play it. It's just a imagined. But might be true. <br />.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL215Lm9wZXJhLmNvbS9vZGVsbG5lbHNvbjEyOC9ibG9nLzIwMTIvMDMvMjAvc3RhcmNyYWZ0LTItZ3VpZGUtb25lLWFjaGlldmVtZW50cy1ob3ctdG8tY29tcGxldGUtdGhpcy1jaGFsbGVuZ2U_" target="_blank">StarCraft 2 Challenge Guide - Are The Challenges Easy In StarCraft 2?</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL29kZWxsbmVsc29uMTI4LmRtdXNpYy5uZXQvam91cm5hbC8zMDM4NjQ_" target="_blank">Hotkeyit – Starcraft 2 Strategy Guide</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGluZy5jb20vZXZlbnRzL2hvdGtleWl0LXN0YXJjcmFmdC0yLXN0cmF0ZWd5LWd1aWRlLTkzOTA2Mw__" target="_blank">StarCraft 2 Challenge Guide - Are The Challenges Easy In StarCraft 2?</a>

On the first Challenge you have to position your troops perfectly and rely on them the right way if you want to repel the attacks. <br /><br />You've got to use the heavy units as a shield so that you won't lose any reduced units. You also ought to move your units should they receive too much damage so they won't die. That is a lot to be careful while you are fighting. But as My partner and i said, you have to get used to that if you want to play better in multiple player mode. <br /><br />Thanks on the StarCraft 2 Challenge guide I could see exactly what I had to do to finish all of them and get all your ranks. You wouldn't believe the quantity of control and the strategies you have to employ in order to help win.

On the first Challenge you have to position your troops perfectly and have tried it the right way if you want to repel the attacks. <br /><br />You've have to use the heavy units as a shield and that means you won't lose any reduced units. You also have to move your units should they receive too much damage so they really won't die. That is a lot to be careful when you are fighting.

You wouldn't believe the quality of control and the strategies you have to employ in order to win. Some Challenges seem really impossible in the beginning, but when you know what you need to do, they will be very simple. <br /><br />The really good part about these is that you will play with every race. That will give you a substantial amount of insight into the other races you will be not playing with. Knowing what the opponent can do is important in a match with players.

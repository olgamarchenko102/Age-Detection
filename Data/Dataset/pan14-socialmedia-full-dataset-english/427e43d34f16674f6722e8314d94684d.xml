With his dummy on his knee, he's going through his usual dumb blonde jokes when a blonde woman in the fourth row stands on her chair and starts shouting: ''I've heard enough of your stupid blonde jokes. What makes you think you can stereotype women that way? What does the color of a person's hair have to do with her worth as a human being? It's guys like you who keep women like me from being respected at work and in the community and from reaching our full potential as a person, because you and your kind continue to perpetuate discrimination against, not only blondes, but women in general...and all in the name of humor!'' 
<br />The ventriloquist is embarrassed and begins to apologize, when the blonde yells, ''You stay out of this, mister! I'm talking to that little jerk on your knee!''

She entered an upscale department store and approached the saleslady in lingerie, ?Do you have a size 28AAAA bra?? 
<br />The clerk haughtily replied in the negative, so she left the store and proceeded to another department store where she is rebuffed in much the same manner. After a third try at another department store in the mall, she had become disgusted. Leaving the mall, she drove to K-Mart. 
<br /><br />Marching up to the sales clerk, she unbuttoned and threw open her blouse, yelling, ?Do you have anything for this?? 
<br /><br />The lady looked closely at her and replied, ?Have you tried Clearasil??

<br />Lost in a crowd, I'm losing my breath.
<br />Lost as a boy, lost as a man, 
<br />I need to grow up, don't think I can.
<br /><br />Lost as a person, can't find my way.
<br />Lost in life, every day.
<br />Lost in worry, who am I? 
<br />All my life, I've lived a lie.
<br /><br />Lost to kindness, lost to love, 
<br />Lost in a sky, like a new-born dove.
<br />Lost in thought, which I shouldn't do, 
<br />It winds me up, I can’t get through.
<br /><br />Lost to comfort, all kind words, 
<br />Lost to advice, it isn't heard.
<br />Lost to those who really care, 
<br />All these people, always there.
<br /><br />Lost in me, I need a break, 
<br />Lost in wonder, which road to take? 
<br />Lost in a place I don't know well, 
<br />Where are you now? There's no one to tell.
<br /><br />Lost here, all alone, 
<br />Lost apart from the mobile phone.
<br />Lost still, there are no calls.
<br />I'm struggling alone, to break these walls.
<br /><br />Lost in mind, lost in soul, 
<br />Lost memories, they're just a hole.
<br />Lost family, lost mate, 
<br />Gone now, yet I'm full of hate.
<br /><br />Lost in a straight world, and I am gay, 
<br />Lost now, for what to say, 
<br />Lost in boredom, think I'll leave.
<br />There's a lot in life I need to achieve.

<br />    the ocean.  Both of them look a little drunk, when one says to
<br />    the other: &quot;Hey, look at the wind whipping up the side of that
<br />    cliff.  It moves pretty fast.  I'll bet I could jump off of the
<br />    ledge, catch the wind in my coat, and get lifted right back up to
<br />    the bar!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;No way&quot;, says the other guy, &quot;you'd fall to your death.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well, I'm going to try it!&quot;, says the first, and at that he walks
<br />    over, stands on the ledge, and leaps off in a swan dive.  Sure
<br />    enough, he comes sailing back up in no time, and lands on his feet
<br />    right in front of the bar.
<br /><br />&quot;I can't believe it!&quot; says the second guy, &quot;that's impossible&quot; . 
<br />    So the first drunk does it again: he jumps off the cliff, catches
<br />    the wind in his coat, and comes sailing back to the bar.
<br /><br />&quot;Go ahead&quot;, he says, &quot;try it, it's great!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well, OK, I'm just drunk enough to give it a go&quot;, says the second
<br />    fellow.  So he climbs the ledge and leaps off the cliff, only to
<br />    fall screaming to his death on the rocks below.
<br /><br />The first guy walks back to the bar and sits down to his drink. 
<br />    The bartender steps over, looks him in the eye, and says to him: 
<br />    &quot;You know, you can be a real jerk sometimes when you've been
<br />    drinking, Superman&quot;.

<br /><br />The blonde came to the door and the milkman said, &quot;I found your note to leave 15 gallons of milk. Did you mean 1.5 gallons?&quot;
<br /><br />The blonde said, &quot;I want 15 gallons. I'm going to fill my bathtub up with milk and take a milk bath.&quot;

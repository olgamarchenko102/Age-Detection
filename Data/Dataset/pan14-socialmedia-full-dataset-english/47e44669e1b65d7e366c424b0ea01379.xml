Here let me give you several tips. When people go shopping online, they would like to see the customers' comments first as a judgment. This is with nothing wrong, but you can never merely judge it according to the comments because it's not hard to make those fault comments.
<br /><br />Except looking at the comments, you'd better observe the photos of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXJ0eWRxLmNvbS8zLWNvY2t0YWlsLXBhcnR5" target="_blank">cocktail dresses</a> carefully. Too many people find that the real goods don't fit the description offered, so when we see the photos, notice whether it's the photo taken by the shop. If it's taken by the shop, the credibility is much better. In addition, you can see the bad comments and the reply by the merchant because their attitude to customers can tell us something, too.

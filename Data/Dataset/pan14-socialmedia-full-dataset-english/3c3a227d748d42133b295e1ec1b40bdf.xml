<br /> know.
<br /><br />How to find LPG cylinder's expiry date Very important information.
<br />   Most of us do not know this. I come to know today from the gas
<br />   stockiest, because here one accident occurred.
<br /><br />Do you know that there is an expiry date (physical life) for LPG
<br /> cylinders?
<br /><br />Expired Cylinders are not safe for use and may cause accidents. In
<br />   this regard please be cautious at the time of accepting any LPG
<br />   cylinder from the vendor.Here is how we can check the expiry of LPG
<br />   cylinders:On one of three side stems of the cylinder, the expiry date
<br />   is coded alpha numerically as follows A or B or C or D and some two
<br />   digit number following this e.g. D06. The alphabets stand for quarters
<br />   - A for March
<br />   (First Qtr), &amp;n bsp; B for June Second Qtr), C for Sept (Third Qtr),
<br />  &amp; D for December (FourthQtr). The digits stand for the year till it is
<br />   valid.
<br /><br />Hence D06 would mean December qtr of 2006. Share this message with
<br />   everyone you know,UR kind cooperation will save life of many people
<br />   and create awareness among the public.
<br />   Life is precious and important...Take care at the utmost!

<br />ALERT WASH BFORE DRINKING
<br /> 0 Ratings
<br />Edit | Author: ShamumbaiR | Filed under: 83
<br /><br />WASH THEM FIRST
<br /><br />Please Don’t Erase this message before forwarding on
<br /><br />ALERT
<br /><br />This is Serious! This incident happened recently in North Texas .
<br />A woman went boating one Sunday taking with her some cans of coke which
<br />she put into the refrigerator of the boat. On Monday she was taken to
<br />the hospital and placed in the Intensive Care Unit. She died on
<br />Wednesday.
<br /><br />The autopsy concluded she died of Leptospirosis. This was traced
<br />to the can of coke she drank from, not using a glass. Tests showed that
<br />the can was infected by dried rat urine and hence the disease
<br />Leptospirosis.
<br /><br />Rat urine contains toxic and deathly substances. It is highly
<br />recommended to thoroughly wash the upper part of all soda
<br />cans before drinking out of them. The cans are typically stocked in
<br />warehouses and transported straight to the shops without being cleaned.
<br /><br />A study at NYCU showed that the tops of all soda
<br />cans are more contaminated than public toilets (i..e).. full of germs
<br />and bacteria. So wash them with water before putting them to the mouth
<br />to avoid any kind of fatal accident.
<br />ALERT
<br /><br />Please forward this message to all the people you care about.
<br />(I JUST DID)

<br /><br />Please do not turn on A/C (Air conditioner) immediately as soon as you enter the car. 
<br />Open the windows after you enter your car and turn ON the air-conditioning 
<br />after a couple of minutes. 
<br />According to a research done, the car dashboard, sofa, air freshener 
<br />emits Benzene, a Cancer causing toxin (carcinogen - take note of the 
<br />heated plastic Smell in your car).In addition to causing cancer, it poisons your bones, causes anemia,and reduces white blood cells. Prolonged exposure will causeLeukemia,increasing the risk of cancer. May also cause miscarriage. 
<br />Acceptable Benzene level indoors is 50 mg per sq. ft... A car parked 
<br />indoors with the windows closed will contain 400-800 mg of Benzene. If 
<br />parked outdoors under the sun at a temperature above 60 degrees F, the 
<br />Benzene level goes up to 2000-4000 mg, 40 times the acceptable level... &amp; the people inside the car will inevitably inhale an excess amount of the toxins. 
<br /><br />It is recommended that you open the windows and door to give time for the interior to air out before you enter. Benzene is a toxin that affects your kidney and liver, and is verydifficult for your body to expel this toxic stuff.

<br />regularly used coconut water - siphoned directly from the nut - to
<br />give emergency plasma transfusions to wounded soldiers..

<br />NO cholesterol!
<br />    *
<br /><br />Coconut Water is More Healthy than Orange Juice - Much lower calories
<br /><br />*

<br />have in our blood.

<br /><br />Coconut water is the very stuff of Nature, biologically Pure,

<br /><br />First, we survived being born to mothers who had no full time maids/cooked food/cleaned the house while they carried us.
<br /><br />They took aspirin, ate cheese , sweet dishes and didn't get tested for diabetes.
<br /><br />Then after that trauma, our baby cribs were covered with bright coloured lead-based paints.
<br /><br />We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, doors or cabinets and when we rode our bikes, we had no helmets, not to mention, the risks we took hitchhiking .
<br /><br />As children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or air bags. 
<br /><br />Riding in the back of a local bus/train was a special treat. 
<br /><br />We drank water from the tap and NOT from a bottle. 
<br /><br />We would spend hours on the terrace under bright sunlight flying our kites, without worrying about the UV effect which never ever effect us. 
<br /><br />We shared one soft drink with four friends, from one bottle and NO ONE actually died from this.
<br /><br />We ate pastries, white bread and real butter and drank soft drinks with sugar in it, but we weren't overweight because...... 
<br /><br />WE WERE ALWAYS OUTSIDE PLAYING!! 
<br /><br />We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back when the streetlights came on.
<br /><br />No one was able to reach us all day. And we were O.K.
<br /><br />We would spend hours reparing our out dated bicycle and scooter out of scraps and then ride down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into the bushes a few times, we learned to solve the problem .
<br /><br />We did not have Playstations, Nintendo's, X-boxes, no video games at all, no 99 channels on cable, no video tape movies, no surround sound, no cell phones, no personal computers, no Internet or Internet chat rooms........! .WE HAD FRIENDS and we went outside and found them! 
<br /><br />We fell out of trees, got cut, broke bones and teeth and there were no lawsuits    from these accidents. 
<br /><br />We ate worms and mud pies made from dirt, and the worms did not live in us forever. 
<br /><br />We were never given BB guns for our 10th birthdays,
<br /><br />We made up games with sticks and tennis balls and although we were told it would happen, we did not put out very many eyes.
<br /><br />We rode bikes or walked to a friend's house and knocked on the door or rang the bell, or just yelled for them!
<br /><br />Cricket League had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those who didn't had to learn to deal with disappointment. Imagine that!!
<br /><br />The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke the law was unheard of. They actually sided with the law! 
<br /><br />This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers, problem solvers and inventors ever!
<br /><br />The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. 
<br /><br />We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned 
<br /><br />HOW TO
<br />DEAL WITH IT ALL!
<br /><br />And YOU are one of them
<br /><br />CONGRATULATIONS!
<br /><br />You might want to share this with others who have had the luck to grow up as kids, before the lawyers and the government regulated our lives for our own good.
<br /><br />and while you are at it, forward it to your kids so they will know how brave their parents were 
<br /><br />Kind of makes you want to run through the house with scissors, doesn't it?!
<br /><br />PS -The big type is because you are short sighted at your age

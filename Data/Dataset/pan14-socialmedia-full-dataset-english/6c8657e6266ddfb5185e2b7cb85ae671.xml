<br />One night a guy &amp; a girl were driving
<br />home from the movies. The boy sensed
<br />there was something wrong because of
<br />the painful silence they shared
<br />between them that night. The girl then
<br />asked the boy to pull over because she
<br />wanted to talk. She told him that her
<br />feelings had changed &amp; that it was
<br />time to move on. A silent tear slid
<br />down his cheek as he slowly reached
<br />into his pocket &amp; passed her a folded
<br />note. At that moment, a drunk driver
<br />was speeding down that very same
<br />street. He swerved right into the
<br />drivers seat, killing the boy.
<br />Miraculously, the girl survived.
<br />Remembering the note, she pulled it
<br />out &amp; read it.
<br />&quot;Without your love, I would die.&quot;

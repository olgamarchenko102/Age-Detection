Some are as plain as Pheobe Philo; some as sharp as John Galliano. It's as if Shakespeare's words &quot;The life is a stage, men and women, just actors and actresses&quot;. No matter low key or high key, that is a role.Seize the Moment!! sheepskin boots is Most Predominant for Grandmother in 2009
<br /><br />Celine again is much accounted of because of Pheobe Philo's returning. There are all Celine fashions outside fashion show. And 2010 autumn and winter absolutely belongs to the most important part of Paris. The gliding line seems especially charming, neat and stylish. The splicing of leather and woolen fabric makes office style especially forceful. It's just clean but it can express all what it wants to say about fashion attitude. And what Stella McCartney shows is also brief creed. The clothing of 09 spring and summer has slightly given away its thought to be brief creed. The big suit has been back to fashion show again, they are all kinds of suits in simple design, most of which are in short style, about second-thirds of legs, the ladies with shorter legs should avoid them. Though it has chiffon see-through blouses at its end and the embroidery it shows is attractive, we can only see the McCartney romance from these chiffon see-through blouses. Minimalism from Pheobo Philo is very effective, but Celine style is more popular in both style and designment.5 Hot Ray Ban Sunglasses Direction of Fashion in the Season of Autumn
<br /><br />The V-neck around the waist is the deepest impression that Balenciaga leaves. The theme of salvage diversifies the materials. This is the style of the designer who favors high-tech. He will, from time to time, excavate some new materials, materials like spongy cushions or material patterns in an old magazine, which brighten the theme. And the futurism is hidden in the pairs of high heels full of strong building feeling. The inerratic color lump and anomalistic color lump of heels is in step very much. The wearing way lumbar V neck also appears on Yohji Yamamoto show and Givenchy show, which adds more optional wearing ways for autumn and winter. All the accurate clipping of Paris fashion week is no longer limited on the shoulder. They are reflected on the lumbar. From the detail, you'll find many complicate lumbar designs. Please try to make your lumbar be shown in this autumn and winter.
<br /><br />The biggest salted fish is Valentino. It seems that the couple of designers still can not step out of their own styles. Regardless of time and brands, the 2010 autumn-winter show counts as perfection. However, when you come to realize the very words of [2010 autumn-winter&quot;, you will find that Valentino seems just to begin its spring and summer, embracing with the margins of the spring-autumn on an initial stage. The fellow sufferers Emanuel Ungaro though pick off the most striking little stickers, it's not forceful enough. The subject is scattered, and a part of clothing are really boorish on matching color. Though Lindsay Lohan, as expected, haven`t participated in the series, the whole party clothes still remain in the 1980s, seemingly unable to step out of the shades. McQueen goes. Whose costumes will Gaga choose as her concave-style capital? The candidates might be Maison Martin Margiela with the chosen single-the huge effort-consuming waist-skirt, or Viktor&amp; Rolf. Of course, the chosen single is the stereo inverse-triangular dress which can both ascend to heaven and descend to earth. Moreover, during her singing, the assistants can help her to accomplish the process. Wearing Giles underwear with more and more gliding line outside is absolutely fit for Gaga's barefaced taste. And hair decorations like sculpture are excellent props for performance on the stage. And Alexander McQueen's posthumous works are left for more classic beauties. Each ready-to-wear is so gorgeous like advanced custom made.
<br /><br />The legendary successor of McQueen-Gareth Pugh makes all the male models in the show the ornaments, wearing feminine designs to serve as foils to female models. Damir Doma is the most gorgeous. Female models with round-framed glasses and men`s costumes seem as handsome as men. The combination of the contour and the skeleton reaches a surprising effect that they walk with a style. The messy match of Vivienne Westwood continues its fun, only with its makeup accessorized by John Galliano with a run. The female models painted with dark brows and tiny mustaches look extremely like Galliano himself, the knave pirate on the Appennino. Each model in Chanel likes to dress themselves like Eskimo, it is nice to mix fur in Tweed, but it will seem boring when you mix huge amount of puff fur with leather. It is normal to see fur boots, like skiwear of D&amp;G, comes into exist in Chanel. What can`t accept in our country is fur trousers, it is exaggerating to wear fur all over your legs. Jean Paul Gaultier mixes various national elements such as Russia, Morocco, Africa and so on. All are mixed together; even the Chinese cotton prints can be seen. The reorganized national elements look rather prosperous, reminding people of Alexander McQueen, the national elements mixing lover.

Hair is mainly composed of keratin which composed of 18 kinds of aminophenol, this kind of keratin contains much more cystine than other aminophenols, the special three-dimensional structure makes hair flexible.
<br /><br />One of the hair functions is to protect the hair and scalp from sun radiation. Because its horny layer can reflect some of the sunshine, meanwhile it soaks up some of the sunshine, or we can say, it is the cystinol that soaks up the ultraviolet ray. If expose the hair to sunlight for a long time, cystine's disulfide bond will breakdown and dissociate, and it will reduce and lose the ability to absorb ultraviolet radiation. Colored hair is easier to fade than natural hair when hurt by the sun.
<br /><br />This is because the hair has been &quot;chemical&quot; damage, combined with hair dye - in particular, organic dye, itself, unstable to light, easy to fade and break down. The curl activators we usually used for perm are cold wave lotions that mainly contain reducible vulcanized glyocllate or derivations of halfcystine.

<br /><br />The sun damage to the hair more and more attracts the attention of people! In order to protect the hair, first, to take physical methods, when in the open-air, or having field work or traveling, can be wearing a hat, or an umbrella; Second it is the chemical protection, use some ultraviolet ray absorbers together with the hair's cystine to absorb ultraviolet ray, these substances have strong absorptive capacity to the ultraviolet ray with wavelength in the 200 ~ 360nm.
<br /><br />Amino acid esters, salicylic acid esters is common suncare material of no stimulation to the skin and low toxicity, and these material has been added to shampoo, hair conditioner, eruptions and etc. The study has confirmed that these UV absorbers reduce the fracture of the disulfide bonds in the hair, the destruction of cystine and the fading effect.

How Can You Resist the Allure of All New Ray Ban Many people cannot help them to touch the face of the precious stones when they see the attractive one, but it will influence the brightness and the lightness of the stones. Human body constantly egests sweat and oil and hands are the most likely part to touch body. Therefore, oil from skin always contaminates our hands. When the jewels are touched by the hands, the oil on the hands will stay on the jewels easily so that the shininess and brightness of the jewels are affected. Especially the diamond which is a kind of lipophilic stone, it is easily to strain with oiliness which will greatly effect on the lightness. While emerald belongs to aggregated structure which means that touch will make it more moist and pretty. Running water do harm to the luster of the pearls: some people want to clean and maintain them after wearing them a few times, but they don`t know that using running water to wash pearls do less harm to the pearls. But pearls must be absolutely no waterlogged for the fixed cl in water will spoil the brightness of the pearls surface. However, the mineral water is the most perfect one to water pearls. Besides, before the pearls are sent to the deposit box in the bank after they are worn, they should be cleaned and maintained so that they won't change color because of long accumulation of dirt later. But for the deposit box preserving bills and documents, the relative humidity is low so that its deposit condition is not suitable for moist jewels such as pearls. Therefore, the pearls should be taken out at regular intervals and be immersed for maintanence and moisture suppiment.

Please pay attention to the acid and alkaline substances: Some substances in our daily lives or we contact with contain different concentrations of acid and alkali substances. And these chemical substances may be harmful to jewelry, especially pearls or other organic gems. The jewelry should be kept away from cosmetics used in daily life.
<br /><br />And pay attention to the sequence of wearing jewelry: when wearing claw-shaped jewelry of rings inlaid with diamonds, caution not to hook your clothes and leather bags, Generally speaking, the proper way is to wear the jewelry after you get dressed. You may image that you put on your prong setting single diamond ring firstly, and then put on your clothes and stocks. Is not that a dangerous thing to your clothes, stocks and your stones?
<br /><br />The worth of small jewel bags: You may heard of the story that the jewel dropped on the floor and damaged, slid into guttering, or left when somebody removed jewels on the washbasin for washing hands. Actually, this crisis is nothing new, but could be avoided. When you are buying jewelry, jewelry store will give you a small jewelry box. Put jewelry into it, this will make jewelry look beautiful. As a matter of fact, such small boxes have different functions. They are small and carrying free. You can put your jewelry in it when washing hands. If you develop this custom, you can reduce the rate of losing your jewelry largely. So don`t feel bother about it, just carrying a small ring box with you!

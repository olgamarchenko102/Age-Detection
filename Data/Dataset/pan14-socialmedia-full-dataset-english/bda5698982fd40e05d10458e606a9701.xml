<br /><br />One night, he decides to bring his
<br />girlfriend home
<br />for a little fun.
<br />They
<br />have bunk beds and the guy notices that
<br />his little
<br />brother is already
<br />asleep
<br />on the lower bunk, so he and his
<br />girlfriend climb
<br />up
<br />to the top bunk.
<br />As you
<br />might expect things start to heat up.
<br /><br />The guy remembers that his little brother
<br />is
<br />sleeping below so he tells
<br />his
<br />girlfriend to whisper &quot;lettuce&quot; if she wants
<br />it
<br />harder and &quot;tomato&quot; if
<br />she
<br />wants a new position.
<br /><br />Lettuce!!!
<br /><br />Tomato!!!
<br /><br />Lettuce!!!
<br /><br />Tomato!!!
<br /><br />Lettuce!!!
<br /><br />Tomato!!!
<br /><br />She screams.
<br /><br />Lettuce!!!
<br /><br />Tomato!!!
<br /><br />Whoa!!!
<br /><br />PULL IT OUT!!!
<br /><br />PULL IT OUT NOW!!!
<br /><br />I can't get pregnant!
<br /><br />Then the little brother shouts up, &quot;Hey,
<br />would you
<br />guys stop making
<br />sandwiches up there! You're getting
<br />mayonnaise
<br />all over my
<br />face!*!*!*!*!

<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that i bought you roses
<br />to tell you that i like you
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I was raised with respect
<br />not to sleep with you when you were drunk
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That my body's not ripped enough
<br />to &quot;satisfy&quot; your wants
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that I open your car door,
<br />and pull out your chair like I was raised
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I'm not cute enough
<br />to be &quot;your guy&quot;
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am actually nice;
<br />not a jerk
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I don't have a huge bank account
<br />to buy you expensive things
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I like to spend quality nights at home
<br />cuddling with you, instead of at a club
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I would rather make love to you then just f**k you
<br />like some random guy.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am always the one you need to talk to,
<br />but never good enough to date
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I always held your hair back when you threw up,
<br />and didn't get mad at you for puking in my car,
<br />but when we went out you went home with another guy
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am there to pick you up at 4am when your new
<br />man hit you and dropped you off in the middle of nowhere,
<br />but not good enough to listen to me when I need a friend.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For being there, and being used as a door mat,
<br />only to be thrown to the side when a jerk comes around.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I listen to you at night talk about how you
<br />wish you could have done something different.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For answering my phone when you call in the
<br />middle of the night to listen to you cry for hours,
<br />instead of getting a couple hours of sleep before work.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I caught your bf with another girl and told you
<br />about it, I thought that was what friends were for...
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For texting you in the middle of the night, and you're
<br />out partying with other friends and just look at
<br />the message, but don't reply
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For being there for you, yet you only come when
<br />you feel alone or when someone has done
<br />something to you, instead of just because.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For having pictures of you in my cell phone.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For taking pictures of you and me, to have memories
<br />of our times, whether good or bad.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For taking pictures of you, and when you look at
<br />them you tell me to delete them because you
<br />don't like how you turned out, yet I love the
<br />way you are all around so I act like I deleted
<br />them just to make you happy but I actually keep
<br />them to look at when you're not around.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For writing poems regarding you.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For calling you in the middle of the night,
<br />just because I want to hear your voice.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For praying for you before I go to bed.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For you being one of my last thoughts
<br />before I fall asleep.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For you being one of my first thoughts
<br />after I wake up.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For fiddling with my phone, and just staring
<br />at your number wishing I could call you
<br />back right after we just hung up.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For calling you during the holidays and even
<br />on your birthday wishing you a good safe day.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For calling you and texting you to be good
<br />and be safe at all times because I care about you.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For making lousy videos, telling you how
<br />much I care about you.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For trying my best to make you smile
<br />each and every day.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That you can't realize...I've been the one all along.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That you can't accept me for who I am.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I can't ever do anything right, and nothing
<br />that I do is good enough to make it in your world.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If you read this and know somebody like this
<br />but don't care
<br /><br />But most of all
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For not being sorry anymore
<br /><br />Ladies always complain and complain to their friends that there is never any good guys out there, and they always end up with jerks who mistreat them. Well ladies next time you're complaining, maybe look up to see who you're complaining to, maybe that special someone is right there hanging on your every word as usual, screaming in his head &quot;Why won't you give me a chance?&quot;
<br />Because the person you are usually searching for is right by you.
<br /><br />If you're a guy and you agree with this letter, repost as &quot;I'm sorry &quot;and add a little if I forgot something.
<br /><br />If You're one of the few girls with enough balls to repost, and you would never make your guy feel this way, repost as &quot;To all the girls who look past the nice guy

<br /><br />1. At least 2 people in this world love you so much they would die for you.
<br /><br />2. At least 15 people in this world love you in some way.
<br /><br />3. The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you.
<br /><br />4. A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't like you.
<br /><br />5. Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep.
<br /><br />6. You mean the world to someone.
<br /><br />7. If not for you, someone may not be living.
<br /><br />8. You are special and unique.
<br /><br />9. Someone that you don't even know exists loves you.
<br /><br />10. When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good comes from it.
<br /><br />11. When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a look: you most likely turned your back on the world.
<br /><br />12. When you think you have no chance of getting what you want, you probably won't get it, but if you believe in yourself, probably, sooner or later, you will get it.
<br /><br />13. Always remember the compliments you received. Forget about the rude remarks.
<br /><br />14. Always tell someone how you feel about them; you will feel much better when they know.
<br /><br />15. If you have a great friend, take the time to let them know that they are great. Add this as a comment to ten of your friends tonight and at midnight your true love will find you. Something good will happen to you at 2:25 tomorrow. Get ready for the biggest shock of your life. Whoever breaks this chain letter will be cursed with 10 relationship problems for the next ten years tag ur it!! this is so scary!!! send this to 15 ppl in the next 143 min. and then press F6 and your crushes name will appear in big letters!! it is so scary because it works.... but if you break the chain.. you will be cursed w/ relationship problems........

This tool helps in protecting the company with a trademark from other competitors who might try to use, steal or replicate their products. The company's intellectual property protection scheme is the one under which you will find the trademark registration. This basically helps you to make an identification mark for your company which states that the trademark cannot be used by any other companies. company registration in india can be carried out with the help of trademark office present in that particular state. India, like all other countries of the world has their set of rules and procedures and their own norms for registering under the trade mark act. fcra registrationThe two other types of registration which are usually as popular as the trademark registration are the nbfc registration and the fcra registration. The non banking financial companies usually opt for these types of registrations. These companies deal with the acquisition of various bonds, shares, debentures, stocks and so on which are usually issued by the government or the local authority. Basically the NBFC's have a function which is very similar to that of banks but the only difference is that they cannot accept demand deposits which are usually funds.The FCRA help in branch office establishment. This act is extremely important in most business because the main aim of the act is to ensure utilization as well as regulation of foreign contribution along with foreign hospitality. This is usually carried out by the people as well as the associations who are involved in the major areas of national life.Again a lot of businesses are small and they simply start out as proprietorships. People who are associated with these businesses run the risk of getting a lawsuit against their business. This is why most people who are involved in a business like this opt for a llp registration in India. An llp registration is called a limited liability partnership. Basically you register with another partner, hence you share the investment. Among the various partners who are there, there is only one partner who is the active partner. This active partner takes care of all the day to day related business activities. In fact, the active partner has the choice to run the business decision of the entire company without even asking the other partners for their opinions. But there is a major drawback to this. Although the active partner might reap the maximum rewards, in the case of the lawsuit or if anything goes wrong, the active partner is the one who is kept on the spot light. But even if you are one of the limited partners, the worst case which could happen to you is that you could lose all your investments because of any bad decisions or loses made by the active partner. llp registration in india

Trademark is a sign used as an indicator of authenticity by any individual or legal entity or any business organization. It is used in order to facilitate a consumer in assuring that the consumed product is original. A product with a trademark on it shows that the product comes from a unique source and also differentiates between two similar products from different entities. A trademark can be a name, phrase, word, logo, image, design or a combination involving these elements. A trademark is like an intellectual property. <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRyYWRlbWFya3JlZ2lzdHJhdGlvbi5jb20vYnJhbmQtcmVnaXN0cmF0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">brand registration in india</a></strong> or in any other country is an equally important affair. In India trademark registration services are available at very affordable prices.
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRyYWRlbWFya3JlZ2lzdHJhdGlvbi5jb20vdHJhZGVtYXJrLXNlYXJjaC8_" target="_blank">trademark search</a></strong> and registration safeguards a person's property and takes care of its unique identity. Each country has its own laws for a patent registration. Patent registration can be filed by a single person, with a partner jointly, or by a legal representative. A <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRyYWRlbWFya3JlZ2lzdHJhdGlvbi5jb20vdHJhZGVtYXJrLWFwcGxpY2F0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">trademark application</a></strong> is required to be filled and submitted for approval. As the application gets processed, it will be passed on to further evaluation and consideration.
<br /><br />In India trademarks are classified in around forty-two distinct classes. These include paints, surgical and medical instruments, machine tools and lubricant machines, textiles, household, games, stationary, beverages, sanitary material, hand tools, leather and educational and scientific products. This <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRyYWRlbWFya3JlZ2lzdHJhdGlvbi5jb20vdHJhZGVtYXJrLWNsYXNzaWZpY2F0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">trademark classification</a></strong> can be further sub-divided. The only objective of sub-classifying these items is to group the similar ones collectively. For example common metals along with their alloys , building material that is transportable, metallic materials used for building railway tracks, common metal wires, non-electric cables, small metal hardware items, ironmongery, tubes and pipes of metal, safes and lockers, other common metal items and ores can be grouped under one category. This grouping is regarding the products. Services may include medical, veterinary, beauty care and hygiene, forestry and horticulture services that can be grouped together being similar or inter-related services.
<br /><br />It is important to search and observe trademark lookup before proceeding. No matter whichever the state or city the business is established within, it is important to note that trademark registration believes in appropriate use of a mark that may contain a legitimate phrase or symbol, both for business processes and for bona fide trading. Hence it is important to make sure that geographical name, surnames, descriptive words are not used. It is clearly mentioned in section nine of Trade and Merchandise Marks act 1958. It is very important for a trademark to be effective. The trademark chosen should be highly distinctive and must not resemble any other trademark especially should never bear any kind of resemblance with products of similar type. Any such resemblance may confuse the consumer and result in selection of another brand. If at small scale, this loss may not count. But if repeated again and again, the confusion can prove to be beneficial to an inferior trademarked company.
<br /><br />These guidelines may seem to be very general, but if not considered during trademark selection, the company will have to regret for the happening at a later stage.

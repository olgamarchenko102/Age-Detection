Mosquitoes congregate near pools of h2o. Dr. McConnell recommends ridding your yard of even the shallowest pools of drinking water (such as the toddler's pool) so mosquitoes don't breed. Additionally, pet owners ought to hold their pets away from bees, wasps and woodpiles that may perhaps harbor spiders.<br /><br />&amp;#8226; Heatstroke-Dr. McConnell recommends keeping &lt;a Href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.officialbroncoproshop.com%2Fpeyton-manning-jerseys-c-21.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.officialbroncoproshop.com/peyton-manning-jerseys-c-21.html</a>]Manning Broncos Jersey[/url]  pets indoors as substantially as possible during the warmest hours of the day (commonly 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.). Never leave your pet in the car unattended.<br /><br />&amp;#8226; Burns-Hot sidewalks can be downright painful for pets and could account for your rise in promises for burns, states Dr. McConnell. In addition to burns on the paws, sunburns are a lot more common in hot months, especially on body areas not protected by fur or dark skin. <br /><br />&amp;#8226; Ear Infections-These are regularly caused by drinking water getting trapped in a dog's ear after swimming or bathing. If your pet is concerned in h2o activities, speak to your veterinarian regarding specific ear-cleaning products that will help dry the ear canal after water exposure to prevent recurring ear infections.<br /><br />&amp;#8226; Near Drownings-Although relatively rare, cases of near drownings do increase in warm climate summer months.

<br />by Stymie63 
<br />Locked in my cage, I stare at the emptiness;
<br />this very emptiness possesses my soul - 
<br />we are one.
<br /><br />The months pass, as do the years, 
<br />yet as time progresses, it loses all relevance. 
<br />I sit here trapped in a recurring nightmare, never to awaken.
<br />I feed on my own self-pity - 
<br />I never hunger. I merely exist, 
<br />captive in this asylum, biding my time; 
<br />my sole gratification, inebriated isolation.
<br /><br />The door to my cage is ajar, as is often the case, 
<br />yet it's pointless to leave; 
<br />each journey leads me back 
<br />to this God-forsaken realm of suffering and despair.
<br /><br />Long ago, I was free; 
<br />I remember faces, smiling faces. 
<br />A different me, in a different time - 
<br />it was a time of fulfillment, of togetherness, of love. 
<br />Then one day the fantasy ended, and I was here . . . 
<br />but enough about the past; I must face my reality.
<br /><br />Distant voices race through my head, 
<br />as I stave off insanity. 
<br />But this time, the voice is real. 
<br />Unsure of its origin, I feel my soul is not as cold; my burden lighter. 
<br />Though I smile, I soon shiver in frustration.
<br />Tears stream down my cheeks, 
<br />as I cannot deny that the other voice is my own, 
<br />as my rationality succumbs to my imagination.

<br />by Moondust 
<br />Purity once had a name,
<br />And beauty once had a face.
<br />Life once had a meaning,
<br />And once I was safe.
<br />Once there was freedom,
<br />And once I could laugh.
<br />Happiness once was alive,
<br />And once I had another half.
<br />Once I shared her love,
<br />Once I was by her side,
<br />Once I felt I fitted,
<br />So quickly that died.
<br />Her grace so great,
<br />Her beauty so vast,
<br />All I ever wanted,
<br />Was for it to last.
<br />Fate maybe had another plan,
<br />Or maybe she had another love,
<br />But it all fell apart,
<br />The hand too big for the glove.
<br />Now it's all died away,
<br />Happiness, joy, love; all memories.
<br />Now I walk alone in this dark, dark world,
<br />With no light to guide my way.

<br />by Cherenee 
<br />Inside my sleeve, I pull out my heart,
<br />handing it to you, &quot;careful it's fragile,
<br />and easily falls apart.&quot;
<br /><br />Extending your arms, you take the heart in
<br />your tender warm hands.
<br />It falls into a million shattered pieces - on
<br />the floor it lands.
<br /><br />You begin to bend down to pick it up, sorrow and
<br />sadness in your eyes.
<br /><br />Apologies are not enough.
<br /><br />Looking at you with tears in my eyes,
<br />I ask you not to pick up the pieces of a heart
<br />that has fallen apart.
<br /><br />I am the one who needs to pick up the pieces of
<br />my shattered heart - one by one, piece by piece.
<br /><br />I need to put it together again, some how. some way.
<br /><br />Each piece of my heart has a memory so true.
<br />Each piece of my heart has part of you.
<br /><br />You are the one who is leaving to start a new lease on life.
<br />I'll just be here on my knees picking up the pieces of a
<br />heart that feels like it's being pierced with a knife.
<br /><br />All my tears won't keep you near
<br />All my tears won't mend what's not here.
<br /><br />Again I look at you with a whisper in my voice,
<br />The only way my heart will mend and finally be complete,
<br />is if you and I can come together without being discreet.
<br />You see, what we have here and today, helps me face the
<br />world, with a love for you that gives a glow -
<br />but now, my darling, you made a choice.
<br /><br />My heart is on this floor, shattered and broke.
<br />With each piece I pick up -
<br />I need to learn to let go.

<br />by Anna Gillis 
<br />You said the words I love you,
<br />But it is obvious things have changed.
<br />I said the words I love you,
<br />And my feelings are still the same.
<br />You said I'll love you forever,
<br />But forever wasn't long enough.
<br />I said I'll love you always,
<br />And I'll mean it forever.
<br />But I can not imply to you
<br />What that means,
<br />'Cause your version of Forever
<br />Isn't what it seems,
<br />And my version of Always
<br />Seems like an unrealistic dream.

<br />© By Raven S. Farrell
<br /><br />Red for the color of her eyes after she cried those tears
<br />For what they left behind was nothing more than a smear
<br /><br />Gray for the sky because you broke her heart
<br />But why did you for she was both beautiful and smart
<br /><br />Black for her heart for she will never love again
<br />And you have created a dead person within! 
<br /><br />I cry for the time that you were almost mine,
<br /> I cry for the memories I've left behind, 
<br />I cry for the pain, the lost, the old the new, 
<br />I cry for the times I thought I had you <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />* You can close your eyes to things you don’t want to see, but you can’t close your heart to things you don’t want to feel. ~ 
<br /><br />* When you said forever, you meant a few months. When I said forever, I meant every day until I died. When you said always, you meant until you couldn't handle it anymore. When I said always, I meant until time ended. When you said you loved me, you meant I was no different from any other girl. When I said I loved you, I meant I had never felt what I felt for you. ~
<br /><br />* With you my heart will always stay. With you my thoughts will be every day. You remain to be the one that I regret letting get away. Why didn't I say what I needed to say? You are the one I will always use my wishes on. You are the one I will always wish was never gone. I'll constantly wonder what went wrong. I'll forever think of what I could've did that was never done. ~ Anonymous
<br /><br />* There's this place in me where your finger prints still rest... your kisses still linger and your whispers softly echo... It's the place where a part of you will forever be a part of me. ~ 
<br /><br />* How could an Angel break my heart? Why did not he catch my falling star? I wish I did not wish so hard. Maybe I wished our love apart. ~ 
<br /><br />* You hurt me once... shame on you. You hurt me twice... shame on me. ~
<br /><br />* True love? I used to believe it existed, but when you’ve had your heart torn out and thrown on the floor, you just don’t care anymore. . Ask me why I keep on loving ~

<br />other people fall in love with you, but you don't have enough time
<br /> to pay attention to the one who already does?
<br /><br />I'm not the girl that runs up to you when I see you 
<br />And I'm not the girl who jumps at every moment 
<br />To talk to you, but I am the girl who keeps it all inside 
<br />And regrets it all later....
<br /><br />Beware of the players, they'll steal your heart
<br />And they'll give it back, all torn apart
<br />Don't let them suck you into their game
<br />Because once you lose, you are never the same
<br /><br />Silly me I believed all the lies, 
<br />I expected a fairytale I'm not surprised,
<br />You cant be with someone for all of time, 
<br />You can pretend but you know it's not fine.
<br /><br />So this is how hearts break, Much more pain than I can take, 
<br />So I'll let you go this time, Don't worry I haven't forgotten how to pretend I'm fine.
<br /><br />Saturday I saw you holding hands with someone new 
<br />Somehow I kept my composure just like everything was cool 
<br />But inside I kept repeating &quot;Don't you let them see you cry&quot; 
<br />So I casually turned my head, As the tears rolled down my eyes
<br /><br />A sweet thing a guy can say is &quot;I love you&quot; but doesn't quite mean it. 
<br />But the sweetest thing he can say is &quot;I don't love you&quot; but cries inside.
<br /><br />I'm scared to fall more in love with you.
<br /> There are plenty of other girls out there that are better then me. 
<br />So why are you settling for me?
<br /><br />I'll sit and I'll smile
<br />as you tell me about your new girl
<br />I hope she's happy...
<br />She gets my whole world.
<br /><br />Now he's calling your house 
<br />Cuz he wants to hang out 
<br />And do that thing you do 
<br />You're getting overexcited and you cannot fight 
<br />The fact that he's bad news
<br /><br />Love? It's kind of complicated, but I'll tell you this... 
<br />the second you're willing to make yourself miserable 
<br />to make someone else happy, that's love right there
<br /><br />Having your boyfriend break up with you and saying &quot;We can still be friends&quot; 
<br />is like having your dog die, and your mom saying you can still keep it
<br />Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them. 
<br />If you do...they might break your heart...
<br />But if you don't... you might break theirs.
<br /><br />knew from the very beginning that you were just a flirt, 
<br />and yet I fell in love with you, knowing I'd get hurt. 
<br />I'll conceal my broken heart behind a smiling face 
<br />and though you thought I never cared, no one can take your place
<br /><br />You'll never know how much I miss you, you won't see it in my face, 
<br />You'll never know there won't be another guy to take your place cause 
<br />I'll be smiling when I see you, no my tears won't ever show, 
<br />I might always love you, but you'll never know...
<br /><br />Everyone says to give up on you, but they don't see you like I do. 
<br />you're the one who broke my heart, you're the reason my world fell apart 
<br />you're the one who made me cry, yet I still love you and I don't know why
<br /><br />Sweet is love when all is sane 
<br />Sweet is death to rid the pain 
<br />Cruel is death when all is well 
<br />Cruel is love when all is hell
<br /><br />Never say I love you, if you don't really care,
<br />Never talk about feelings, if they aren't really there.
<br />Never hold my hand, if you're going to break my heart,
<br />Never say you're going to, if you don't plan to start.
<br />Never look into my eyes, if all you do is lie,
<br />Never say hello if you really mean goodbye.
<br />If you really mean forever, then say that you will try,
<br />Never say forever, because forever makes me cry

<br /><br />[Talking:]
<br />You know with each day that passes by, I pray to god I'll never forget who you are.
<br />You mean everything to me.
<br />I love you
<br /><br />Ooooh Ooooh 
<br />Ooh I pray
<br /><br />You were in my dream
<br />Before I even knew that there was a you and me,
<br />Now I can't wait to see your smile,
<br />When I wake up each day,
<br />It makes it worth while
<br />With the kinda love you plant inside, 
<br />Specially with a heart so empty as mine.
<br />All your soft tenderness is the one thing that I don't wanna miss.
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br />I pray,
<br />When it's time for me to say goodbye
<br />I'll never forget looking in your eyes,
<br />I pray,
<br />That I feel your touch 
<br />And that God doesn't forget our love,
<br />I pray,
<br />When I close my eyes,
<br />I can still see visions of you on my mind.
<br />I pray,
<br />That I see you in another life,
<br />I pray that you still by my side.
<br />Oh I pray.
<br /><br />Everything that you give to me,
<br />Only comes in a fantasy,
<br />It seems like life goes by so fast,
<br />But in this time I wanna make it last. (I pray)
<br />I hate that we live to die,
<br />But only God knows why (I pray)
<br />We all have a purpose, 
<br />And to see you again it'll be worth it.
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br /><br />[Slow rap:]
<br />I wish that I could stop time,
<br />I wish that I could rewind,
<br />To the very begining of every second of my life.
<br />To ask God on my hands and knees,
<br />To never let me forget all my special memories.
<br />See I'm only promised today,
<br />And if it's my time to go,
<br />I don't want the love of my life to ever fade away,
<br />So one last time
<br />Let me open my eyes.
<br />To see what my life used to be like.
<br />Oh God.

<br />by Little T 
<br />Loneliness is blue like sadness.
<br />It tastes like a sour lime with salt on it.
<br />It smells like rotten food and causes madness.
<br />For fun it likes to do nothing but bad things.
<br />While almost everything makes it angry
<br />Everything makes it sad,
<br />But nothing makes it happy.
<br /><br />Loneliness is smaller than you and me,
<br />But bigger than peoples' minds.
<br />Happiness is its enemy,
<br />But nothing can be its friend.
<br />Loneliness keeps its happy feelings in a secret place.
<br />Its favorite place is in peoples' minds.
<br />But it hates to be anywhere else.
<br />Making people feel bad is its greatest success.
<br />Not cheering people up it is greatest failure.
<br />Loneliness makes me feel as sad as a deserted island.

<br />When I was just a little girl,
<br />My mama used to tuck me into bed,
<br />And she'd read me a story.
<br /><br />It always was about a princess in distress
<br />And how a guy would save her
<br />And end up with the glory.
<br /><br />I'd lie in bed
<br />And think about
<br />The person that I wanted to be,
<br /><br />Then one day I realized
<br />The fairy tale life wasn’t for me.
<br /><br />I don’t wanna be like Cinderella,
<br />Sitting in a dark, cold, dusty cellar,
<br />Waiting for somebody to come and set me free (Come and set me free)
<br />I don’t wanna be like someone waiting
<br />For a handsome prince to come and save me
<br />On I will survive
<br />Unless somebody's on my side
<br />Don't wanna depend on no one else.
<br />I’d rather rescue myself.
<br /><br />Someday I'm gonna find Someone
<br />Who wants my soul, heart and mind
<br />Who's not afraid to show that he loves me
<br />Somebody who will understand I'm happy just the way i am
<br />Don't need nobody taking care of me
<br />(i will be there)I will be there for him just as strong as he will be there for me
<br />when i give myself then it has got to be an equal thing
<br /><br />I can slay (I can slay) my own dragons. (My own dragons)
<br />I can dream my own dreams. (My own dreams)
<br />My knight in shining armor (shining armor) is me.
<br />So I'm gonna set me free.
<br /><br />I don’t wanna be like Cinderella,
<br />Sitting in a dark, cold, dusty cellar,
<br />Waiting for somebody to come and set me free.
<br />I don’t wanna be like someone waiting
<br />For a handsome prince to come and save me
<br />On I will survive
<br />Unless somebody's on my side
<br /><br />I don’t wanna be like Cinderella,
<br />Sitting in a dark, cold, dusty cellar,
<br />Waiting for somebody (oh - Oh) to come and set me free.
<br />I don’t wanna be like someone waiting
<br />For a handsome prince to come and save me
<br />On I will survive
<br />Unless somebody's on my side
<br />Don't wanna depend on no one else.
<br />I’d rather rescue myself.
<br /><br />I don’t wanna be like Cinderella,

<br />the time your scrapped your knee
<br />or the time he decided he doesn't love you anymore
<br /><br />Perfection, another one of your inventions.

<br />For too long that's wrong
<br /><br />[Ne-Yo:]

<br /><br />cold, shivering, tearful, breakable, numb, like you'll never get it right, like you'll never be good enough, worthless, ugly, broken, shattered, in pieces, like you could break down any minute and cry forever, like you could jump off a really tall building, like you could walk in front of a moving car and let yourself get run over, like nothing in this world matters anymore.
<br /><br />My only one 
<br /><br />when i first met you
<br />i knew there was something special
<br />i knew that i was going to enjoy and love every moment with you
<br />we hooked up one weekend
<br />went to the movies and everything felt so right
<br />butterflies in my stomach,my heart beating so fast

<br />my heart started beating even faster that's when i knew i wanted to become your lil shawty

<br />I know this day belongs to you
<br />For upon this day you were born
<br />But being apart on your special day
<br />Leaves my heart shattered and torn
<br /><br />I wanted to give you a special gift
<br />One that would surely last
<br />Something to put a song in my heart
<br />And dry away the tears
<br /><br />I thought perhaps balloons or flowers
<br />To put upon your grave
<br />But I knew that eventually
<br />They would just wither away
<br /><br />I thought about it long and hard
<br />What gift would surely last
<br />Something that you've never had
<br />On your birthday in the past
<br /><br />I realized that such a gift
<br />Couldn't come close to compare
<br />To the grand celebration
<br />That you must be having up there
<br /><br />So I'm sending you a birthday wish
<br />From the bottom of my heart
<br />To give me strength and courage
<br />Everyday that we're apart
<br /><br />I know you're happy in heaven
<br />With no sorrow, tears or pain
<br />But sometimes I'm so lonesome
<br />My tears fall like rain
<br /><br />So on your special day
<br />My wish I send to you
<br />Is someday I'll be with you
<br />When my chores on earth are thru
<br /><br />And as I tarry on thru the years
<br />Hold my wish close to your heart
<br />For God will come and take me home
<br />As long as I do my part
<br /><br />For now I must travel thru life alone
<br />For He isn't ready for me yet
<br />But what a glorious reunion we'll have
<br />When your smiling face I see
<br /><br />So on your birthday this year
<br />My wish I send to you
<br />Keep looking for me, don't give up

<br />At first we loved, but not again.
<br />We met at the mall,
<br />and we talked ever since.
<br />We stood starring at each other,
<br />I wondered the time, we'd
<br />Stand together. Holding hands
<br />as we walk down the street,
<br />I wondered when our lips
<br />Would meet.
<br />My heart is broken, u seem
<br />to ignore, The pain I
<br />have, when u left me sore.
<br />Our love was strong In which now your
<br />heart is blind to see, now I feel
<br />that your love has forgotten
<br />completely about me.
<br />Well all in all I'm heartbroken
<br />Without u by my side,
<br />I wish we could love each
<br />other like we did that one time. 
<br /><br />A Deadly Love
<br />© By Felicia Renee McCormick
<br /><br />You walked into my life,
<br /><br />not knowing what to expect.
<br /><br />The anger and darkness that filled me frightened you,
<br /><br />but something kept you from leaving me.
<br /><br />Not knowing why you're still here,
<br /><br />your mind is a roller coaster of thoughts,
<br /><br />and feelings you never expected,
<br /><br />But strangely you never wanted them to end.
<br /><br />I could see your feelings grow for me;
<br /><br />the lust in your eyes cannot be mistaken,
<br /><br />with each day it grows more and more,
<br /><br />like the moon in the night's sky.
<br /><br />You're still confused on why you stay,
<br /><br />Knowing that your life could end at any moment.
<br /><br />The danger you're in, from just being with me,
<br /><br />excites you in a way you never knew existed.
<br /><br />What you don't realize is that I know what you are feeling;
<br /><br />you generally love me for the person I am.
<br /><br />What you don't know is that I am not a person at all,
<br /><br />but a creature of the night, a creature that could kill you at any moment.
<br /><br />And yet I let you stay, knowing what I could do,
<br /><br />I fear that I might have feelings for you.
<br /><br />They grow with each passing moment of time we spend together,
<br /><br />but I could never let it go too far, for you would never come back.
<br /><br />So as I watch you, and see your love grow for me,
<br /><br />I know that soon you will be gone forever.
<br /><br />And somehow you know this too,
<br /><br />but you're not afraid you're numbed by your lust for me.
<br /><br />As I watch you die, knowing I could have stopped it,
<br /><br />I tell myself that you meant nothing, but we both know that's not true,
<br /><br />I truly loved you and look at what I did to you.
<br /><br />Broken Heart
<br />© By Sarah B. Woods
<br /><br />You and I were the greatest thing
<br />Laughter and smiles is what we would bring
<br /><br />We would talk on the phone, until it was time for bed
<br />Even then I would see you, in my dreams, inside my head
<br /><br />Every time I saw you, I would always smile
<br />You could see a glow in my eyes from miles and miles
<br /><br />Man, I wish I was still holding onto you
<br />But you gotta girl now, so what can I do?
<br /><br />Now when I see you, there's always a frown
<br />Won't you please turn that sad frown upside down?
<br /><br />If you're not happy with this person, then just say goodbye
<br />Because seeing you depressed, brings tears to my eyes
<br /><br />Today I approached you, but you didn't say a word
<br />I still have feelings for you, haven't you heard?
<br /><br />I miss seeing you smile and laugh
<br />Won't you please remember the fun we had?
<br /><br />Holding hands coming from lunch
<br />Wow! I miss you a whole bunch
<br /><br />Just ask my family, you were all I talked about
<br />Now all I do is walk around the house and pout
<br /><br />I love hearing your voice; it brings a smile to my face
<br />It's a sound that I shall always embrace
<br /><br />I had no idea I actually felt this way
<br />Please tell me, why does it feel like you're pushing me away?
<br /><br />The reason we broke up, I don't even know why
<br />Just thinking about you now makes me want to cry
<br /><br />It was peer pressure; they said you lied too much
<br />But I would easily take you back with just one touch
<br /><br />The one your with, for you, doesn't even care
<br />That is why right now she gets pretty mean stares
<br /><br />Enough about her, she makes me sick
<br />I miss you way more than just a little bit
<br /><br />I need to toughen up; I know we'll always be apart
<br />That is the reason why right now, I have a broken heart

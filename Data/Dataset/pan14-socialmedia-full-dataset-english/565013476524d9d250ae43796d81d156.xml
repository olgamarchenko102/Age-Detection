<br />girl sensed there was something wrong because of the painful
<br />silence they shared between them that night. The guy pulled over and told the girl he wanted to talk. He told her that his feelings had changed &amp; that it was time to move on. A silent tear slid down her cheek as she slowly reached into her pocket &amp; passed him a folded note. At that moment, a drunk driver was speeding down that very same street. He swerved
<br />right into the girls side, killing the girl. Miraculously, the guy survived. Remembering the note, he pulled it out &amp; read it.
<br />&quot;Without your love, I would die.&quot; <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />nurse- young man, visiting hours are over. 
<br /><br />BOY LEAVES, GIRL IS TAKEN OFF LIFE SUPPORT, AND DIES. 
<br /><br />but wht the boy didn't kno is that the girl only asked him those questions so she could hear him say it one last time, and she only broke up w/him because she knew she only had 3 more weeks to live, and thought it would cause him less pain and give him time to get over her before she died. 
<br /><br />NEXT DAY 
<br /><br />the boy is found dead with a gun in his hand…with a note in the other... 
<br />THE NOTE SAID: 
<br /><br />i told her i would take a bullet for her.... 
<br />just like she said she would die for me... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />-advil is like crack. end of story.
<br /><br />-we will never be too old for sleepovers.
<br /><br />-gossip isnt a sin. its an art.
<br /><br />-we arent ashamed to cry.
<br /><br />-we must go to the bathroom in groups
<br /><br />-we have this thing called feelings. dont hurt them.
<br /><br />-we dont wake up looking pretty. it takes time and effort.
<br /><br />-sometimes is just never quite enough.
<br /><br />-we need girls nights OFTEN.
<br /><br />-we hold grudges and we never forget the things you say to us that hurt.
<br /><br />-it doesnt matter who dumped who or why. whenever we see an ex with another girl, it always bothers us. not because were not over you, but because we know we used to be that girl.
<br /><br />-makeup can hide so many things, like puffy eyes from crying to huge scars from a broken heart
<br /><br />-never ever ask a girl what she weighs; or imply anything about her weight being too much or too little. just don`t do it.
<br /><br />-never ask a girl if shes being so snotty cause of PMS...cause other things annoy us...duh
<br /><br />-as much as we say we didnt like u that much...we did
<br /><br />-girls notice every little thing so be careful what you say (or don't say) and do (or don't do)
<br /><br />-our eyes are located in our heads. not our chest or butt. when youre not looking in our eyes, WE KN0W.
<br /><br />-we get a feeling in our gut when things are wrong (seriously true)
<br /><br />-sometimes we trust you because we want to even when we know you are lying, and it hurts
<br /><br />-Hugs are like Medicine....So give them to us <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/kiss.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />&quot;Maybe you're just scared
<br />because for once in your life
<br />someone actually wants to be with you.&quot;
<br /><br />It hurts to lose your towel 
<br />when your eyes are full of soap
<br />but it hurts even more to be rejected 
<br />when your heart is full of hope.
<br /><br />It's not about who you spend most of your time with. It's about who you have the best 
<br />memories with.
<br /><br />I can forgive,
<br />but I can't forget
<br />and I hope you know
<br />you've lost my respect.
<br /><br />Shes the type of girl
<br />who tries not to like you..
<br />but ends up falling for
<br />you even harder/this would be me
<br /><br />you can waste your life drawing lines,
<br />or you can live your life [-crossing-] them.
<br /><br />You change for only two reasons: you learn enough that you want to or you hurt enough that you have to.
<br /><br />failure isn't falling down
<br />it's remaining where you've fallen
<br /><br />experience is a hard teacher – It gives you the test first and the lesson later
<br /><br />years of friendship &amp;&amp; nothing to doubt;
<br />endless memories - too many to count.
<br />laughter . lies . &amp; stupid fights.
<br />they're my bestfriends ;
<br />my hearts; my life . xoxo
<br /><br />a little jealousy in a relationship is healthy.
<br />it's good to know that somebody is afraid to lose you.
<br /><br />oh the way you make me smile
<br />i haven't done that in awhile

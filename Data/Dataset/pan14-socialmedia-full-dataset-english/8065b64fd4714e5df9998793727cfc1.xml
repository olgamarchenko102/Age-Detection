<br /><br />An elegant watch is part of most women’s jewellery collection. Ladies watches by Cartier are as distinctive as they are diverse. Owning and wearing one of these luxury timepieces is a combination of status and elegance which cannot be equaled. 
<br /><br />Although a modern design the Roadster also carries an element of the past. For many people these watches are a contemporary, less expensive alternative to the Tortue designs which the Roadster most closely resembles. The Santos model was introduced in 1904, and has a geometric feel and design. The &amp;quot;square within a rectangle&amp;quot; is instantly recognizable, and it remains one of the most desirable and distinctive designs for ladies. The Pasha line is among the oldest and most celebrated designs. It features a circular shape and Arabic as opposed to Roman numerals on the head. It was designed to remain worn in the water and is described as an extremely durable and exclusive watch.

Royalties, aristocrats, businessmen, other rich people were very loyal to these timepieces. Men were not the only patrons; even women grew a large fascination for it which they mostly used as jewelry accessories. 
<br /><br />The exquisite design and unmatched elegance of Cartier watches makes them a good choice for anyone looking for a fashionable and precise watch. They are available in all kinds of breathtaking styles. Few of them are listed below:
<br /><br />Roadster: The Roadster line was released back in 2001 as a throwback to the sports cars of the 1950s and 1960s. It has a racy look with sleek curves, much as you'd find on a alluring car. The Roadster's shape is very similar to the timeless Tortue model, though in general tends to be less exhorbitant. 
<br /><br />Tortue: The Cartier Tortue was initially created as a woman's watch. In fact, the first men's Tortue came out in 1928, more than 15 years after the ladies watch first became available. This line is stunningly curvaceous and is a legendary shape highly valued by collectors. The high price tag is indicative of this. 
<br /><br />Tank: Cartier's Tank watch was first released back in 1917, and remains popular today - it is another of Cartier's iconic lines. Simple but elegant, Tank is a rectangular watch but includes a number of &quot;sub-styles&quot; such as Americaine, Francaise, Solo, Divan and others. Each style varies by shape of the rectangle and Prices differ widely within the Tank sub-styles as well. 
<br /><br />Tankissime: While undoubtedly similar to Tank's basic shape and style, Tankissime is in a class of its own. It is an extraordinarily exquisite watch with a sleek silver or gold band that's possibly better called a bracelet. The band is often lined with diamonds making it one of Cartier's most exquisite and prestigious timepieces. The Tankissime tends to carry a five figure price tag which makes it among the most expensive Cartier watches for women. 
<br /><br />Pasha: Pasha is among Cartier's oldest lines, but provides a varied choice of styles more than able to serve modern tastes too. It was first designed as a swimming watch given its sleek, circular design that's inherently durable and water resistant. As opposed to various other lines the Pasha face features numbers, as opposed to roman numerals. 
<br /><br />Santos: Santos personifies the timelessness of Cartier with a presentation as current now as it was more than a century ago when released in 1904. The face pays homage to fine geometric form with its iconic square inside a rectangle design. Rounded corners give the timepiece an air of flow and energy.

The Offshore features a matte finish accompanied by a polished bezel so it appears sophisticated and contemporary. The distinctive attributes of this particular watch are highlighted with the eight screws that go from the bezel to the back. Now, even though the other exterior highlights of the Royal Oak Offshore Chronograph are remarkable, we'll concentrate more on its interior characteristics.
<br /><br />This timepiece combines the Calibre 2126 movement from Jaeger LeCoultre. You might be questioning, why would AP obtain such an important part of its wrist watch from another company? AP in fact owns 40% of Jaeger LeCoultre therefore it is no real surprise that they supply inner elements from this company. The Calibre 2126 is an automatic movement which measures 26mm in diameter and it has a power reserve of 45 hours. This watch is extremely accurate. Even though it was technically rated as water resistant for up to 100 meters, tests reveal that it could endure up to 300 meters without having a problem.

<br /><br />Fake watches are made in substandard materials and do not last long. It may have the same attributes of the original but their features are not working as accurately and efficiently. For example, a replica may also have a sub-dial feature but is not really working as a stopwatch.

Has Cartier gotten by, simply on their good looks? No, the Cartier reputation of excellence has been built on a combination of factors. Yes, their designs are universally appealing, their Tank and Pasha watch creations are loved the world over, as are many others. 
<br /><br />A Cartier watch has the look of classic elegance, but looks aren't everything, and Cartier knows this all too well. Cartier's watch functioning and movements are just as prominent as their legendary designs. Their Quartz, as well as their hand wound mechanical movements, and automatic winding models are of exceptional quality, so how do you decide which will work best for you, when you look to make your watch purchase? Whether you are in the mood for a sport watch or a luxury version, such as <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXdjYXZlbmRpc2hqZXdlbGxlcnMuY29tL2MvNDEvY2FydGllci13YXRjaGVzLmFzcHg_" target="_blank">Cartier watches</a>, understanding watch terminology is important. Let's go over a few key terms:
<br /><br />What's the difference between a Chronograph and a Chronometer? A Chronograph refers to a watch, which offers a stopwatch. It may have 2 or 3 different registers. Some quartz chronographs will time tenths of a second. You may not find a mechanical watch to time this way, most mechanicals are not equipped to time in this way. A Chronometer is a timepiece, which has passed specific tests. There are a series of tests, measuring the accuracy of the movement in various temperatures and stressful environments. The watch must pass all tests, in order to be a certified chronometer.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXdjYXZlbmRpc2hqZXdlbGxlcnMuY29tL2MvNDEvY2FydGllci13YXRjaGVzLmFzcHg_" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/175834683_9108830_47456127.jpg" /></a>
<br /><br />What type of crystal might be used on a luxury watch? Watch crystals come in three categories; Sapphire crystal is the most expensive, but also the most durable watch crystal. It is used by most major brands. Mineral crystal is made from hardened glass. This glass is solid, but prone to shattering.

<br /><br />This IWC Pilot's Watches collection is composed of several variants with seductive aesthetic and technique just like the plane the watches have been named after: Spitfire. The current Spitfire series of IWC - the Double Chronograph, the Chronograph Automatic, the UTC and the Mark XVI - honors the extraordinary technique and the elegance of the mythical plane. The digits and the pointers are placed as props on the dial. The surfaces of the dial are refined in a galvanic bath that therefore emits a glossy matte shine and project a powerful elegance. They are available in black or silver. The hour hand and the minute hand, as well as the dial, are covered with a luminescent mixture to facilitate night vision. Of course, the protection against magnetic fields is present in every IWC model.

This practical accessory makes a statement about your style. There are a wide range of designs available to choose from such as fashion watches, sports watches and designer watches. The sophisticated style and diversity makes <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXdjYXZlbmRpc2hqZXdlbGxlcnMuY29tL2MvNDEvY2FydGllci13YXRjaGVzLmFzcHg_" target="_blank">Cartier watches</a> appealing to a wide variety of people starting with members of royal families, celebrities and ending with common people who sometimes save money for years to make the dream of owning a Cartier watch come true.
<br /><br />Cartier men's and women's watches are world famous and come in very stylized frames. The look is exciting and the new designs have almost certainly brought in new and more interested consumers. Cartier has a timeless feature that is hard to explain. The look of their collections is diverse, but they have learned that staying true to some of their old faithful is a smart business move.
<br /><br />Cartier was the first contractor engaging in manufacturing pocket watches. The splendid timepieces produced by the brand are well received for their practical functions. For instance, they are of high accuracy and can endure the test of pressure and altitude. In addition, they are manufactured with high quality materials and the latest technology, which have added great charm to the splendid timepieces and help the brand achieve a substantial market share among other luxury brands. Maybe the most prominent feature of Cartier watches lies in their four digit code reference numbers, which help avoid imitations.
<br /><br />As to how Cartier men's and women's watches were invented is yet another interesting story. Cartier met a famous Brazilian pilot, Alberto Santos Dumont, in 1904 and found that the pilot was unable to depend on his pocket watch especially during escape from mishaps or accidents. It was then that Louis Cartier took the responsibility of creating men's watches in particular and thus the Cartier men's watch brand was born. This also marked the trend of classic designs in men's watches. One of the things that have contributed to the success of the line of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXdjYXZlbmRpc2hqZXdlbGxlcnMuY29tL2MvNDEvY2FydGllci13YXRjaGVzLmFzcHg_" target="_blank">Cartier watches</a> is the passion that Louis Cartier had for watch making.
<br /><br />A few of its most noteworthy designs are the Pasha, Santos 100 and the Roadster range. Such elegantly designed watches are an ideal choice to express your personality as well as enhancing your appearance. Why not treat yourself to a timepiece? I'm sure it is worth every penny of your hard earned money and you will enjoy wearing such a splendid timepiece.

No matter what the occasion is, but the thing that matters is the quality of watch worn by the people on their wrists. Looking at the increasing demands from the public, several watch making brands have come up with innumerable varieties of watches that are especially meant for a particular occasion. However, people need to be careful while heading towards any particular watch brand.
<br /><br />With advancements in technology, the markets are filled with a number of watches having differing functionality along with magnificent precision. Among the wide range of luxury watches, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXdjYXZlbmRpc2hqZXdlbGxlcnMuY29tL2MvMTI2L2JyZWd1ZXQtd2F0Y2hlcy5hc3B4" target="_blank">Breguet watches</a> are the most sought after ones.

These watches prove to be the perfect choice for those individuals who love to enjoy ultimate elegance and supreme prestige. Owners of this brand of watch understand and rely on its supreme technology and accuracy, as well as the cutting edge style. Absolutely every aspect of this brand is superior from how the watch performs to how it looks on your wrist.
<br /><br />There are specific collections for men and women. There are some things that make men’s watches different from others. The difference is that men's watches always come with a large case while women's watches come with a case with a smaller size because their wrists are slimmer than men's. 
<br /><br />The gentlemen's collection would likely consist of the following: Classique, Marine, Heritage, Type XX, XXI, and La tradition. Several are generally basic wrist watches with popular circular pieces and often with soldered lugs and reeded bezels. Others tend to be water resistant which can be recognized by the use of crown guards as well as wrist watches based on World War II Era aircraft pilots. Additionally they possess durable chronographs and open-faced watches with some motion on the front, in addition to a small face. 
<br /><br />For ladies, they are similar to the gentlemen’s; the only variation is they have Type XX and Reine de Naples-oval bezels. They tend to be primarily identified by their diamonds and also consist of an automatic movement with power reserve and moon phase complications. The look and feel of these watches is made to feel comfortable and beautiful on the smaller wrist of a woman, and of course include all of the precision and detail of the men's line.

IWC is notable for being the only major Swiss watch factory located in Eastern Switzerland, as the majority of Swiss watch manufacturers are based in Western Switzerland.
<br /><br />In 1868 American engineer and watchmaker Florentine Ariosto Jones founded the International Watch Company.  His intention was to combine the craftsmanship of the Swiss with modern engineering technology from the U.S. to manufacture watch parts for the American market. With its passion for innovation and technical inventiveness, IWC Schaffhausen has established an international reputation. Since 1868, the Swiss watch manufacturers have been creating masterpieces of haute horlogerie that combine precision engineering with exclusive design.
<br /><br />The company began keeping detailed records for every watch that has left their factory since 1885.  For a small fee the owner can obtain precise information about their watch as long as the watch is at least 10 years old.  IWC’s service department has the parts and is capable of repairing and maintaining watches from every era since the IWC’s foundation in 1868.
<br /><br />The IWC’s watch families are proof of the expertise of the engineers.  From robust watches for everyday use to professional sports watches, to the complexities of Haute Horologerie.  The seven families at IWC are Da Vinci, Aquatimer, Pilot’s Watches, Ingenieur, Portofino, Portuguese and IWC Vintage Collection.  
<br /><br />The IWC also produces high end special editions and their Protuguese Siderale Scafusia is the most exclusive and most complicated mechanical watch ever created by IWC Schaffhausen.  The design of the dial is of the same characteristic and style as that of the entire IWC Portuguese watch family. Apart from standard time it also has a display at 12 o’clock showing sidereal time which is vital to astronomers. The newly developed constant-force tourbillon, which combines a tourbillion with a constant-force mechanism, guarantees a regular and precise rate for a period of at least 48 hours.  The 90-hour scale of the power reserve display at 4.30 underscores the enormous power generated by the two barrels.  The choice of materials for the case, the five different colours for the dial, the various colours for the appliqués and the straps and the material used for the straps result in over 200 different design options.
<br /><br />If you are looking to add one of the IWC’s amazing watches to your accessory collection what better way than to browse their collections online. New Cavendish Jewellers has an extensive collection of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXdjYXZlbmRpc2hqZXdlbGxlcnMuY29tL2MvNTIvaXdjLXdhdGNoZXMuYXNweA__" target="_blank">IWC watches</a> available to purchase through their online store.

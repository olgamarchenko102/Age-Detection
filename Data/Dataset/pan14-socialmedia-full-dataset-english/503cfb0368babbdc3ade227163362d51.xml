Because there are many different silhouettes available, and different silhouettes suit different figures. 
<br />This section focuses on the five basic wedding dress styles: A-line/Princess, Empire, Mermaid/Fishtail, Ball Gown, and Column. The purpose of outlining each of these silhouettes is to provide you with the necessary information you need to find the dress that is best suited for you. Each of these sections details the different necklines, sleeve lengths, dress lengths, and fabric choices that are best suited for each style. By walking into a bridal store with a clear idea of what you want, you will be saving yourself (and the salon clerk) a lot of headache. However, there is not a golden rule in wedding dress designs, and you owe it to yourself, and your future husband, to be adventurous when tying on gowns. You will never know what you look like in certain styles if you never try them on. Who knows, the style that you may think would look the worst on your body type might just be the one you end up choosing.
<br />Let’s take a look at A-line/ Princess wedding dresses first.
<br />The A-line wedding dress features a shape that is fitted around the bodice and flows out to the ground, resembling the outline of an uppercase A. The dress flows fluidly from the bust to the hem with an unbroken line. Due to its classic and simple style, the A-line dress is appropriate for any occasion, from a quiet backyard gathering, to a traditional church ceremony.
<br />Options: The A-line is a versatile shape since it can accommodate many different structural elements, including horizontal seems that help define your waistline, or a separate bodice and skirt that feature contrasting fabrics. The look of the A-line dress is also dependent upon length, which can range from above the knee for a fun and flirty bride, to a full-length dress that flows into a chapel-length train for the more traditional bride.
<br />The princess cut is the most dramatic variation of the A-line dress. This style emphasizes the clean lines of the A-line by utilizing vertical panels that run from the neckline to the hem. The princess style provides elongating lines that create a slimming effect since your eye focuses on the length created by these long, smooth seems.
<br />The A-line style can support many different fabric choices, depending on the look you want. If you desire a simple look, free flowing silks like charmeuse are the best option because they allow the dress to hang naturally and create a soft feminine silhouette. If you want a more structured appearance that emphasizes the continuity of the A-line style, you will want a heavier fabric that can maintain shape, such as peau de soie silk or satin. This same effect can also be achieved with the use of organza, or other supporting fabrics, that can be layered to create a full skirt.
<br />You can also affect the look of the A-line dress depending upon the added embellishments you choose. Lace overlays or bead work can make a simple A-line dress appear more formal, while a touch of color provided by a ribbon or bow can make a stylish statement.
<br />Things to Consider: 
<br />The A-line wedding dress is flattering on almost all body types. The long lines of the princess cut dress can create the illusion of height on a shorter body, as well as slim down a rounded figure. The full skirt of the A-line can also hide a larger lower body, or create the illusion of curves on a narrow frame. Since the A-line dress is so versatile, simple modifications to the neckline, waistline, or fabric can accentuate your best features and hide those your not so fond of.

As the wedding dress has a special meaning, every bride wishes to have a perfect dress for the wedding. The bride can be the most beautiful women in the ceremoney when she is in the wedding dress. It plays a very important role in the wedding.
<br /><br />First ,You need to be patient and plan carefully when you make the choice of your dress. There are countless styles and fabrics for the wedding dresses, and you have to choose the right one for you. Traditionally, the white dress is most popular because white symbolizes purity and chastity. If you don't want a white dress, you can choose from a wide range of colors: Champagne, Ivory, Pearl, Cream and so on.
<br /><br />Second, the fabrics for the dress are taffeta, satin, organza and so on. Before you start to choose the dress, you can have a look at some wedding magazines for inspiration. And also you can find a lot of wedding dresses on the internet. There will be many wonderful models on the web.

Most of them have no differences with the new ones and are in low price. Meanwhile you can buy the dress from the internet. There are many online shops which sell the dresses for the bride.

<br />2. Choosing a dress with an asymmetrical hem can give you the look of a full length dress with a higher front hem. This will make walking easier as well.
<br />3. A column style dress is cool and simple, but can also be elegant with the right fabric.

<br />Elegance and glamour are the basic components of a luxurious wedding. We all understand that the bride gown are the most significant in entire weddings, as well, the &lt;a  href= <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.topons.com%2Fbridesmaid-dresses-c220.html%26gt%3Bbridesmaid"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.topons.com/bridesmaid-dresses-c220.html&gt;bridesmaid</a> dresses&lt;/a&gt; are an absolutely crucial part. Based on my know-how and what I discovered from the latest tendency publication and articles, &lt;a href= <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.topons.com%2Fbridesmaid-dresses-c220.html%26gt%3BKnee-length"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.topons.com/bridesmaid-dresses-c220.html&gt;Knee-length</a> bridesmaid dresses&lt;/a&gt; should be the most option for any kind type of bridesmaid. 
<br />as we all know ,there are so many people are obsessed with the knee-length bridesmand dresses .that is because a knee length dress is a casual way (as opposed to a suit) for a professional woman to dress in the office for casual Friday without looking like she’s doing housework. A dress can mean business but remain attractive, and can be a practical washability and foldability for travel. The length of dress other than knee length is a mini or an evening gown of floor length. A knee length dress can be a tasteful way to show a shapely pair of legs or showcase specialty shoes without revealing too much skin or leg.
<br />The closet of every woman has a knee length dress that can be worn to a meeting, to the office, to court, to dinner, or to a dining or social engagement. Tea length dresses flirt lower than the knee hem and hover around the mid-calf. These types of dresses were a transition between the formal longer dresses of the turn of the century and the shocking brevity of flapper fashion in the 1920’s. The tea length dress softened a woman’s silhouette and lengthened the eye.
<br />&lt;a href=<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.topons.com%2Fbridemaid-dress-sale.html%26gt%3BA"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.topons.com/bridemaid-dress-sale.html&gt;A</a> knee length dress&lt;/a&gt; can be easily found in the dresser’s favorite color. This is a must when looking to coordinate the knee length dress into an existing wardrobe of accessories, shoes, scarves, purses, and jackets. Basis colors like black, white, red, navy, green and gray are usual tones for basic knit styles. Print or woven material dresses follow a more flirty, social event scale suitable for church or warm weather social functions. A knee length dress will always be more formal than a blouse and skirt.
<br />If you have trouble in choosing the right bridesmaid dress, you might as well come to the professional bridal consultant or get some help from your friends and family. anyway ,the keen length will be the favorites in my eyes .
<br />If you are looking for a beautiful &lt;a href=<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.topons.com%2Fbridesmaid-dresses-c220.html%26gt%3Bknee"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.topons.com/bridesmaid-dresses-c220.html&gt;knee</a> length dress&lt;/a&gt; for some special event, then look no further.

Even though you are not the bride on that day, you still have the right to dress yourself beautifully and make your friend happily. However, How to choose a &lt;a href=<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.topons.com%2Fwedding-party-dresses-c730.html%26gt%3Bperfect"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.topons.com/wedding-party-dresses-c730.html&gt;perfect</a> bridesmaid dress&lt;/a&gt; may be a little bit challenging. And today some designers and dressmakers are trying to create some wonderful styles of gowns so they can be worn again for some special occasions, not just for a wedding ceremony.
<br /><br />For most of the bridesmaids ,it is very difficult to choose the right dresses that they like .There are some tips in getting a bridesmaid dress and here are as follows
<br /><br />Step  1: Making a budget
<br /><br />You must agree a price range first because whoever pays must be comfortable with the decision. Be sensitive to those who may feel they have to go along with the other bridesmaids but may be stretching their resources. Price will determine what your range of options are and where you go to buy your dresses. You may be able to deal with the maker of your bride’s dress if you are also shopping for &lt;a href= <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.topons.com%2Ffluorescent-green-bridesmaid-dress-strapless-floor-length-chiffon-bridesmaid-dress.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.topons.com/fluorescent-green-bridesmaid-dress-strapless-floor-length-chiffon-bridesmaid-dress.html</a> &gt;bridesmaids’ dresses&lt;/a&gt;.  Shop around online at the discounted price or some other channels . Come back with some ideas of costs.
<br /><br />Step  2: Selecting the style
<br />Choosing a popular style for your &lt;a href= <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.topons.com%2Ffluorescent-green-bridesmaid-dress-strapless-floor-length-chiffon-bridesmaid-dress.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.topons.com/fluorescent-green-bridesmaid-dress-strapless-floor-length-chiffon-bridesmaid-dress.html</a> &gt;bridesmaid dresses&lt;/a&gt;. There are a series of styles of bridesmaid gowns. First look at styles that will be appropriate for the formality of the wedding as well as the venue and also the time of year. Floor length dresses are best for formal wedding, but if you will be getting married on the beach, a shorter dress made from a lighter fabric would be the best choice . In position, keen length dresses are more casual and comfortable. With simple design and delicate cut, it often can be worn in another cocktail party.
<br /><br />Step  3: Choosing the color
<br />Unless you have a specific color in your mind, pink or black bridesmaid dress probably will be your best choice. If you want your bridesmaid differently, green or yellow will light up your whole wedding. Remember the general rules of choosing a bridesmaid dress Beware of the bright one — dark tones will help inexpensive bridesmaid dress but look rich. 
<br /><br />Step  4: getting some idea from friends There is no doubt a fitting should be arranged before the wedding. Gather the girls in your house and try it one by one. You can get a lot of valuable feedback from your buddies. If those live in a long distance, you can also send some photos by email and let them give you some advice. Your best friends ‘opinion is the most important.
<br /><br />And finally , Finding the perfect &lt;a href=<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.topons.com%2Fwedding-party-dresses-c730.html%26gt%3BBridesmaid"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.topons.com/wedding-party-dresses-c730.html&gt;Bridesmaid</a> Dresses&lt;/a&gt; for a wedding shouldn't take too much time and patience. As they say, this is the most important day of your life. If your bridesmaids are happy with their dresses and look gorgeous they will give you and everyone else a lot of pride and pleasure and a wedding day to remember.

<br /><br />dresses-2011.html&quot;&gt;bridesmaid dresses&lt;/a&gt; for your bridemaid , it is 
<br /><br />necessary to ask them what style would make them feel prettiest. 
<br /><br />Actually, a bride should ask for that type of input from all of her 
<br /><br />bridesmaids, but it is especially important for those who may have a 
<br /><br />hard time finding formal attire in which they feel comfortable. 
<br /><br />Remember not to choose a style for the average sized ladies but is not 
<br /><br />available in a plus size.  It would make the fuller figured attendant 
<br /><br />feel awful as she had to shop for something else because she could not 
<br /><br />fit into what the other girls were wearing.
<br /><br />Secondly ,pick the colors that will suit your bridesmaids. Generally, 
<br /><br />dark and lively colors make plus size women look slim but light colors 
<br /><br />make women a little fat. This factor should be laid significant amount 
<br /><br />of stress. Besides this, you should also pay attention to the color of 
<br /><br />the bridesmaid. Dark colors would not suit dark complexion bridesmaids. 
<br /><br />You just need to flatter your bridesmaid. Take your bridesmaids with 
<br /><br />you and ask them their choice. The best is to ask her to try it on and 
<br /><br />see if it fits her . You should try your level best to not to choose 
<br /><br />any heavy designs as they make plus size bridesmaid to look more heavy.
<br /><br />Third ,It is a good idea to select a dress style with a shawl or has 
<br /><br />sleeves of some sort. Full figured women usually are not willing to 
<br /><br />show their arms. Gowns with shawls or sleeves are able to make them 
<br /><br />feel more comfortable at the wedding party. Therefore, if you are 
<br /><br />getting married in summer, opt for dresses designed with cap sleeves. 
<br /><br />For brides who are planning to have winter weddings, pick gowns with 
<br /><br />long sleeves for your plus size bridesmaids to make them feel more at 
<br /><br />ease. Your full figured bridesmaids will be thankful if you choose 
<br /><br />dresses with belt, sash or other details that can take attention away 
<br /><br />from their bad body parts.

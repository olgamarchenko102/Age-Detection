<br /><br />Love Compatibility of Leo with Capricorn
<br />Capricorns are conservative and practical, and might be annoyed by your playful ways. While Goats want to get ahead, Lions just want to be admired. Your Capricorn can be condescending, and your relationship could end up with more of a parent-child dynamic than a romantic one. But if you can learn the virtues of hard work and responsibility - and start taking responsibility for your own well-being - your Goat will be able to see you as a valuable part of his or her life. They might just lighten up and start learning how to have a little more fun, too.
<br /><br />Love Compatibility of Leo with Aries
<br />Leos are ruled by the sun, making you brilliant, creative, generous and open-hearted. You live to love and be loved. When you hook up with an Aries, who is also a fire sign, the romance is red-hot. You both have a childlike wonder about the world around you and an unmatched enthusiasm when you fall in love with someone. You'll have a great time stirring up all kinds of activities and enjoyment. Remember that Ram playmates grow bored of almost any game quickly, and you'll need to have a few tricks stashed up your sleeve to keep your partner interested.
<br /><br />Love Compatibility of Leo with Taurus
<br />Bulls are sensual creatures who seek simple pleasures. Lions need to receive plenty of love and attention to feel secure in a relationship. You're both loyal in love, but because you're both fixed signs, you can be stubborn and difficult. You both understand the concept of taking - it's giving that you both aren't always so great at. If you can get past your own needs - and accept each other's unique way of expressing love - this can be an exciting match with long-term potential, and one that will teach you both how to give freely of yourselves.
<br /><br />Love Compatibility of Leo with Gemini
<br />Geminis love all aspects of communication, and you'll be immediately mesmerized by their wit and charm. When a Leo and a Gemini hook up, the attraction is powerful and magnetic, heightening your mutual curiosity not only about each other, but about the world around you as well. You make great playmates in life and work - creative sparks fly between you just as often and as easily as physical ones. Just make sure you play nice. You may not have the gift of words that your Gemini love does, but that doesn't mean you aren't just as capable of putting on a show.
<br /><br />Love Compatibility of Leo with Cancer
<br />Lions and Crabs are like night and day when it comes to relationships. You're bright and sunny, while Cancer is moody, introverted and sensitive. You can easily outshine your Crab. You'll never want for love or affection in this relationship - which is the most important thing to a Leo. Your Cancer doesn't need as much attention and affection, but what a Crab does need is to feel secure. Before getting involved with a Cancer, you'll need to ask yourself if you're capable of providing the reassurance necessary to make this partner feel safe with you.
<br /><br />Love Compatibility of Leo with Leo
<br />When two Lions hook up, there might be some competition. While you both want to be the alpha cat at all times, you'll both have to step back from time to time and let the other lead. The secret to your success is to not take yourselves so seriously - laugh at your quirks, break the rules and compliment each other, often. You're two creative souls who don't just suspect you're special - you know it. Your weaknesses are arrogance and pride. If you learn how to quiet your partner's roar and make them purr instead, you might just be able to make it work.
<br /><br />Love Compatibility of Leo with Virgo
<br />Virgos always want the upper hand in relationships. They are smart and efficient, and use their sharp intellectual to take power whenever and wherever they can. If you're a clever Lion, you'll find plenty of ways to humor your Virgo, letting them believe they hold all the cards. Underneath their judgmental exterior, though, Virgos are witty and funny. They laugh at themselves easily, especially when someone calls their bluff. You may feel pressure from Virgo to be perfect, but you can calm their critical nature every time with a positive attitude.
<br /><br />Love Compatibility of Leo with Libra
<br />You like to jump right in and get your hand dirty, Leo, while your Libra prefers to coach from the sidelines. You will have many things in common, though, including a love of theaters, museums and the arts in general. While some people find your Leonine antics amusing, Libra may disapprove. And while some signs are intimidated by or fascinated with Libra's quiet sophistication, you may find it stuffy and dull. More often, however, your differences will strike the delicate balance you need to form a long-lasting, happiness-filled relationship.
<br /><br />Love Compatibility of Leo with Scorpio
<br />Scorpios prefer to play out their dramas in private, and might find the Lion's loud roar childish and hard to understand. They need a lot of emotional space and clear boundaries, while you need over-the-top displays of love and affection. You might not get what you need with a Scorpio, who is more reserved with their love. It's not hopeless, though. If you can learn not to express absolutely everything you feel, all the time, and your Scorpio can understand that you need attention and make an effort to be more demonstrative, you can make it work.
<br /><br />Love Compatibility of Leo with Sagittarius
<br />When two explorers hook up, it makes for a relationship that's never boring. You and Sagittarius both love social events, sports and adventures of all types. Your Archer will open your eyes to the world around you, and you'll never tire of hearing them speak passionately about saving the world. This is a relationship full of optimism, playfulness and passion. It may not have long-term potential, though, because you both tend to live in the moment and aren't terribly concerned with building a solid foundation for the future. But it will be fun while it lasts
<br /><br />Love Compatibility of Leo with Aquarius
<br />Aquarius and Leo are opposite signs of the zodiac. Opposites always attract, but they don't always work out in the long run. You're both fixed signs as well, making you stubborn and unyielding. The problem is, you want to be appreciated without any criticism, ever. Aquarius would rather be right all the time than cater to your ego. You do find each other intriguing, though, and you'll both be eager to give it a try. This relationship might not have forever written all over it, but it's not impossible. All it takes is a little flexibility and a lot of perseverance.
<br /><br />Love Compatibility of Leo with Pisces
<br />You tend to put yourself first, Leo, while Pisces rarely give themselves center stage. This fish is compassionate and gentle, and may be baffled by your self-confident and larger-than-life ways. Pisces lives under the seas of their imagination, and through undercurrents of feelings and sensitivity. You aren't comfortable showing your vulnerability, preferring to roar with pride instead. Pisces has enough humility for both of you. It won't be easy, but if you can wade out into your fish's water, and your Pisces can venture onto dry land, it might just work.

<br />Body: guys cry because...
<br /><br />1. Girls screw them over...
<br />2. They just got hit in the balls...
<br />3. They're about to die...
<br />4. Their heart is broken..
<br />5. Because they are true men.
<br /><br />GIRLS: If you see a guy crying, hug him close and hold him up as he gets over the pain of getting kicked in the nuts. Tell him he's not going to die, and if he's crying over a girl... hug him and kiss him and let him know you won't screw him over and break his heart like the last girl did. Guys just want to know that our girls will be there for us to support us when we need them and help us get our mind off the pain of heartbreak, getting kicked in the balls, and knowing we're gonna die.
<br /><br />Girls cry because...
<br /><br />1. They're sad...
<br />2. They're scared...
<br />3. They're nervous...
<br />4. They're frustrated...
<br />5. They're missing someone...
<br />6. They're alone...
<br />7. They're PMSing...
<br />8. They're pregnant..
<br />9. Their heart is broken...
<br />10. They're in love...
<br />11. Their souls have been torn...
<br />12. THEY MET A BOY THEY CANT HAVE...
<br />13. They fell in love with a boy...
<br />14. They hurt so bad inside...
<br />15. They're mad...
<br />16. Something bad happend...
<br />17. JUST BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE CRYING
<br /><br />******BOYS: If any girl you know is crying and you see them, don't just stand there and say you're sorry. Hold them and tell them everything will be okay, even if you have no idea what is wrong with them. Girls just want to be held and know that someone cares about them.

<br /><br />cashier hand this little boy his money back saying
<br /><br />&quot;I'm sorry, but you don't have enough money to buy
<br /><br />this doll.&quot;
<br /><br />Then the little boy turned to the old woman
<br /><br />next to him: ''Granny, are you sure I don't have
<br /><br />enough money?''
<br /><br />The old lady replied: ''You know that you
<br /><br />don't have enough money to buy this doll, my dear.''
<br /><br />Then she asked him to stay there for 5
<br /><br />minutes while she went to look around. She left
<br /><br />quickly.
<br /><br />The little boy was still holding the doll in
<br /><br />his hand.
<br /><br />Finally, I walked toward him and I asked
<br />him
<br /><br />who he wished to give this doll to.
<br /><br />&quot;It's the doll that my sister loved most and
<br /><br />wanted so much for this Christmas.
<br />She was so sure that Santa
<br /><br />Claus would bring it to her.&quot;
<br /><br />I replied to him that maybe Santa Claus will
<br /><br />bring it to her after all, and not
<br />to worry.
<br /><br />But he replied to me sadly. &quot;No, Santa Claus
<br /><br />can't bring it to her where she is now. I have to
<br /><br />give the doll to my mommy so
<br />that she can give it to
<br /><br />my sister when she goes there.&quot;
<br /><br />His eyes were so sad while saying this. &quot;My
<br /><br />sister has gone to be with God. Daddy
<br />says that
<br /><br />Mommy is going to see God very soon too, so I
<br /><br />thought that she could take the doll with her to
<br /><br />give it to my sister.''
<br /><br />My heart nearly stopped.
<br /><br />The little boy looked up at me and said: &quot;I
<br /><br />told daddy to tell mommy not to go yet. I need
<br />her
<br /><br />to wait until I come back from the mall.&quot;
<br /><br />Then he showed me a very nice photo of him
<br /><br />where he was laughing. He then told me
<br />&quot;I want mommy
<br /><br />to take my picture with her so she won't forget me.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I love my mommy and I wish she doesn't have
<br /><br />to leave me, but daddy says that she has to go to be
<br /><br />with my little sister.&quot;
<br /><br />Then he looked again at the doll with sad
<br /><br />eyes, very quietly.
<br /><br />I quickly reached for my wallet and said to
<br /><br />the boy. &quot;What if we checked again, just in case you
<br /><br />do have enough money?''
<br /><br />&quot;OK&quot; he said &quot;I hope that I have enough.&quot; I
<br /><br />added some of my money to his without him seeing and
<br /><br />we started to count it. There was enough for the
<br /><br />doll and even some spare money.
<br /><br />The little boy said: &quot;Thank you God for
<br /><br />giving me enough money!&quot;
<br /><br />Then he looked at me and added &quot;I asked
<br /><br />yesterday before I slept for God to make sure I have
<br /><br />enough money to buy this doll so that mommy can give
<br /><br />it to my sister. He heard me!''
<br /><br />&quot;I also wanted to have enough money to buy a
<br /><br />white rose for my mommy, but I didn't dare to ask
<br /><br />God for too much. But He gave me enough to buy the
<br /><br />doll and a white rose.''
<br /><br />&quot;My mommy loves white roses.&quot;
<br /><br />A few minutes later, the old lady came again
<br /><br />and I left with my basket.
<br /><br />I finished my shopping in a totally
<br /><br />different state from when I started. I couldn't get the little boy
<br /><br />out of my mind.
<br /><br />Then I remembered a local newspaper article
<br /><br />2 days ago, which mentioned of a drunk man in a truck, who hit
<br /><br />a car, where there was one young lady and a little
<br /><br />girl.
<br /><br />The little girl died right away, and the
<br /><br />mother was left in a critical state. The family had
<br /><br />to decide whether to pull the plug on the
<br /><br />life-assisting machine, because the young lady would
<br /><br />not be able to recover from the coma.
<br /><br />Was this the family of the little boy?
<br /><br />Two days after this encounter with the
<br /><br />little boy, I read in the newspaper that the young
<br /><br />lady had passed away.
<br /><br />I couldn't stop myself as I bought a bunch
<br /><br />of white roses and I went to the funeral home where
<br /><br />the body of the young woman was exposed for people
<br /><br />to see and make last wishes before burial.
<br /><br />She was there, in her coffin, holding a
<br /><br />beautiful white rose in her hand with the photo of
<br /><br />the little boy and the doll placed over her chest.
<br /><br />I left the place, teary-eyed, feeling that
<br /><br />my life had been changed forever. The love that this
<br /><br />little boy had for his mother and his sister is
<br /><br />still, to this day, hard to imagine. And in a
<br /><br />fraction of a second,
<br />a drunk driver had taken all
<br /><br />this away from him.

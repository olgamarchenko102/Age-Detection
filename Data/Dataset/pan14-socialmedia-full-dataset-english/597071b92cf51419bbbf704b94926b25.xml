<br /><br />..  
<br /><br />..
<br /><br />Lost in a world, that scares me to death, 
<br />Lost in a crowd, I'm losing my breath.
<br />Lost as a girl, lost as a woman, 
<br />I need to grow up, don't think I can.
<br /><br />Lost as a person, can't find my way.
<br />Lost in life, every day.
<br />Lost in worry, who am I? 
<br />All my life, I've lived a lie.
<br /><br />Lost to kindness, lost to love, 
<br />Lost in a sky, like a new-born dove.
<br />Lost in thought, which I shouldn't do, 
<br />It winds me up, I can’t get through.
<br /><br />Lost to comfort, all kind words, 
<br />Lost to advice, it isn't heard.
<br />Lost to those who really care, 
<br />All these people, always there.
<br /><br />Lost in me, I need a break, 
<br />Lost in wonder, which road to take? 
<br />Lost in a place I don't know well, 
<br />Where are you now? There's no one to tell

<br /><br />I feel the dark cold clammy touch of it 
<br />It haunts me in my dreams 
<br />It makes me cry and wonder why 
<br />I suffer as I do.
<br /><br />I wonder when it will go away 
<br />When the pain will subside 
<br />But as I sit here in my false reality 
<br />My mind and soul slowly die. 
<br /><br />My tears stain my cheeks as they slide down my face 
<br />It hurt so long, so long 
<br />I've kept these tears deep inside 
<br />That relief is bitterly sweet. 
<br /><br />My head is pounding and my brain is swimming 
<br />My eyes are red and sore 
<br />I feel my heart is at its last 
<br />I can feel the fear no more. 
<br /><br />My body is slowly numbing 
<br />The pain is almost gone 
<br />I close my eyes and prepare myself 
<br />For my mind is at its last. 
<br /><br />My throat goes dry as sand 
<br />My skin is freezing cold 
<br />But I lie awake 
<br />Eyes as wide as ever 
<br /><br />But my mind has become no more.

<br />Nothing matters anymore
<br />I've turned away and locked the door 
<br />I've turned the key and closed my eyes 
<br />Let spill the tears and stop the lies 
<br /><br />I want no more to do with this place 
<br />I want to leave without a trace 
<br />To pack my bags and disappear 
<br />To have no regret to have no fear 
<br /><br />To abandon all my life long dreams 
<br />To stop the nighttime nightmare screams 
<br />To leave behind the pain and despair 
<br />To move on with existence without a care 
<br /><br />If only this could all be true 
<br />To go away and start anew 
<br />But I must live with these tears and lies 
<br />So I'll lock the door and close my eyes.

<br /><br />I've been dragged deep, far away,
<br />He was never meant to hurt me, not this way.
<br />I was blinded by the moon and shadows made by the light,
<br />Now i'm not here anymore, he took me with the night.
<br />I called out to you but my words were unspoken,
<br />And when he called me the silence was broken.
<br /><br />All I have is midnight Whispers, calling me now he can't reach me anymore.
<br /><br />I can't breathe, I can't find peace,
<br />I am all alone left with his secrets. 
<br />And now the dark waters cover me whole,
<br />I can't fight back because I have become the sorrow.
<br />My life is an echo of what he wanted to believe,
<br />He held me under until I learned not to breathe.
<br /><br />Now all I hear is Midnight Whispers, calling me now he can't reach me anymore.
<br /><br />And it turned still and I cried into the night,
<br />Into nothing...into nothing...just like he wanted.

<br /><br />I see the stars sparkling so bright,
<br />Within the moon kissed sky.
<br />I hear the lark so sweetly sing,
<br />Amidst the morning dawn.
<br />I smell the flower full in bloom,
<br />And see their royal pomp.
<br /><br />And yet some place so deep within,
<br />I'm shrouded and I'm closed.
<br />The brilliance there I can't see,
<br />In mists of misery.
<br />Enshrined inside, unable thus,
<br />To touch the warmth without.
<br /><br />I gaze upon this passion spent,
<br /><br />And yet . . . Inside I die.

<br /><br />I'm swimming all alone in a pool of darkness
<br />and I feel like darkness is slowly pulling me under
<br />I yell for help but no one is there to hear it
<br />I begin to see the water at eye level
<br />and I kick and flail
<br />fighting to stay above the darkness
<br />But the darkness won't let go of its hold on me
<br />and I slowly begin to give in
<br />to the feeling that lies below the water line
<br />the waters starts to fill my lungs
<br />the lungs that once held so much life
<br />yet now they allow the murky water to replace that
<br />I know that this path doesn't lead to happiness
<br />But why doesn't someone grab my hand
<br />pull me from darkness's grasp?
<br />because no one knows I stand at the boundary
<br />the boundary between light and dark
<br />so I give in to the thing that holds me
<br />All of the strength and all of the courage
<br />that I once held in my heart
<br />can't save me from the water
<br />So I slowly slip below the world of conscientiousness
<br />undetected by the occupants of that world
<br />I don't want to fight anymore
<br />I've given into darkness

<br /><br />Harsh words &amp; violent blows
<br /><br />Hidden secrets nobody knows
<br /><br />Eyes are open, hands are fisted
<br /><br />Deep inside I'm warped &amp; twisted
<br /><br />So many tricks &amp; so many lies
<br /><br />Too many whens &amp; too many whys
<br /><br />Nobody's special, nobody's gifted
<br /><br />I'm just me, warped &amp; twisted
<br /><br />Sleeping awake &amp; choking on a dream
<br /><br />Listening loudly to a silent scream
<br /><br />Call my mind, the number's unlisted
<br /><br />Lost in someone so warped &amp; twisted
<br /><br />On my knees, alive but dead
<br /><br />Look at the invisible blood I've bled
<br /><br />I'm not gone, my mind has drifted
<br /><br />Don't expect much, I'm warped &amp; twisted
<br /><br />Burnt out, wasted, empty, &amp; hollow
<br /><br />Today's just yesterday's tomorrow
<br /><br />The sun died out, the ashes sifted
<br /><br />I'm still here, warped &amp; twisted

<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; it was dead.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'How do you know that the cat was dead?' she asked her pupil. 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'Because I pissed in its ear and it didn't move,' answered the
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; child innocently.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; You did WHAT ? ! ?' the teacher exclaimed in surprise. 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'You know,'explained the boy, 'I leaned over and went 'Pssst!'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; and it didn't move.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 2. A small boy is sent to bed by his father. 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; Five minutes later.....'Da-ad....'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'What?'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'I'm thirsty. Can you bring me a drink of water?'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'No, You had your chance. Lights out.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; Five minutes later: 'Da-aaaad.....'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'WHAT?'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'I'm THIRSTY. Can I have a drink of water??' 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; I told you NO! If you ask again, I'll have to spank you!!'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; Five minutes later......'Daaaa-aaaad.....'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'WHAT!' 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'When you come in to spank me, can you bring a drink of
<br />&gt;water?'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 3. An exasperated mother, whose son was always getting into
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; mischief, finally asked him, 'How do you expect to get into
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; Heaven?'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The boy thought it over and said, 'Well, I'll run in and out 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; and in and out and keep slamming the door until St. Peter
<br />&gt;says,
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'For Heaven's sake, Dylan, come in or stay out!''
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 4. One summer evening during a violent thunderstorm 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; a mother was tucking her son into bed.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; She was about to turn off the light when he asked with a
<br />&gt;tremor
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; in his voice, 'Mommy, will you sleep with me tonight?' 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The mother smiled and gave him a reassuring hug.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'I can't dear,' she said. 'I have to sleep in Daddy's room.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; A long silence was broken at last by his shaky little voice: 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'The big sissy.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 5. It was that time, during the Sunday morning service, for
<br />&gt;the
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; children's sermon. All the children were invited to come 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; forward. One little girl was wearing a particularly pretty
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; dress and, as she sat down, the pastor leaned over and said,
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'That is a very pretty dress. Is it your Easter Dress?' 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The little girl replied, directly into the pastor's clip-on
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; microphone, 'Yes, and my Mom says it's a bitch to iron.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 6. When I was six months pregnant with my third child, my 
<br />&gt;three
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; year old came into the room when I was just getting ready to
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; get into the shower. She said, 'Mommy, you are getting fat!'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; I replied, 'Yes, honey, remember Mommy has a baby growing in 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; her tummy.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'I know,' she replied, but what's growing in your butt?'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 7. A little boy was doing his math homework. He said to 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; himself, 'Two plus five, that son of a bitch is seven.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; Three plus six, that son of a bitch is nine....'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; His mother heard what he was saying and gasped, 'What are you 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; doing?
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The little boy answered, 'I'm doing my math homework, Mom.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'And this is how your teacher taught you to do it?' the 
<br />&gt;mother
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; asked.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'Yes,' he answered.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; Infuriated, the mother asked the teacher the next day, 'What
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; are you teaching my son in math?' 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The teacher replied, 'Right now, we are learning addition.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The mother asked, 'And are you teaching them to say two plus
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; two, that son of a bitch is four?' 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; After the teacher stopped laughing, she answered, 'What I
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; taught them was, two plus two, THE SUM OF WHICH, is four.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 8. One day the first grade teacher was reading the story of 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; Chicken Little to her class. She came to the part of the story
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; where Chicken Little tried to warn the farmer. She read, '....
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; and so Chicken Little went up to the farmer and said, 'The sky 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; is falling, the sky is falling!'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The teacher paused then asked the class,
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'And what do you think that farmer said?'
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; One little girl raised her hand and said, 'I think he said:
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'Holy Shit! A talking chicken!''
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The teacher was unable to teach for the next 10 minutes. 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 9. A certain little girl, when asked her name, would reply,
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'I'm Mr. Sugarbrown's daughter.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; Her mother told her this was wrong, she must say, 'I'm Jane 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; Sugarbrown.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The Vicar spoke to her in Sunday School, and said,
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'Aren't you Mr. Sugarbrown's daughter?'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; She replied, 'I thought I was, but mother says I'm not.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 10. A little girl asked her mother, 'Can I go outside and play
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; with the boys?' 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; Her mother replied, 'No, you can't play with the boys, they're
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; too rough.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The little girl thought about it for a few moments and asked, 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'If I can find a smooth one, can I play with him?'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 11. A little girl goes to the barber shop with her father.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; She stands next to the barber chair, while her dad gets his 
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; hair cut, eating a snack cake. The barber says to her,
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'Sweetheart, you're gonna get hair on your Twinkie.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; She says, 'Yes, I know, and I'm gonna get boobs too.'

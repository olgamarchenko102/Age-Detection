Not as sexually exciting as a 'Where would you fuck me? quiz' nor as deep as chain letters about lovers dying in car crashes, but here goes:
<br /><br />I don't know if you've heard but there's been a Gay Rally in Russia which wasn't government approved (yes isn't it a sorry state of things when the government has to 'approve' a protest rally) and, to cut a long story short, loads of anti-homosexual and right-wing pricks beat the shit out of a lot of the demonstrators. 
<br />And the police let them do it.
<br /><br />Michael Parenti not-very-famously said: 
<br /><br />&quot;There are people who believe that the function of the police is to fight crime. That's not true, the function of the police is social control and protection of property.&quot;
<br /><br />I guess this is what he means.
<br /><br />I my opinion the police should have nothing to do with the political system and should instead be a seperate body free from government influence. only then can we ensure a fair system not biased towards one particular race, gender or sexuality over another. As it stands there are endless tales of bias and brutality from the police - the people who are employed to protect us - from democratic societies all over the world that in the end you have to ask yourself if democracy is still as perfect as the world leaders would have you believe.
<br /><br />I seriously doubt that anyone on this site actually cares about stuff like this, but hey, prove me wrong.
<br /><br />Here is the BBC's account of the incident: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.bbc.co.uk%2F1%2Fhi%2Fworld%2Feurope%2F6696329.stm"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6696329.stm</a>
<br /><br />Also, if you want to listen to any of Michael Parenti's speeches then go here: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.radio4all.net%2Findex.php%3Fop%3Dsearch%26amp%3Bnav%3D%26amp%3Bsession%3D%26amp%3Bsearchtext%3Dmichael%2Bparenti"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.radio4all.net/index.php?op=search&amp;nav=&amp;session=&amp;searchtext=michael+parenti</a>

I think the original definition (and the one that i'd go with) is a band abandoning it's roots and ONLY making music for personal gain, whether it be for money, fame or acceptance.
<br /><br />unfortunately it now seems to be a blanket term used purely to hate on bands that someone doesn't like ie: &quot;I don't like this band, therefore they have sold out.&quot; or &quot;I don't like this bands latest album - it sounds different from there other stuff, they've fuckin sold out.&quot;
<br /><br />It's called artistic progression, churning out the same record again and again isn't exactly exciting not for the band, or for the fans, but a few are just determined to hate. As long as they don't change their sound just so more people will like them and so they'll get more money, i'm cool with it.
<br /><br />Same goes for when a band that is relatively underground, gets loads of new fans - &quot;they're popular now so I don't feel special anymore liking a really obscure band&quot;. bullshit, enjoy the music ya bunch of bastards.
<br /><br />ok so anti-flag and against me! have signed with majors, yes, in my opinion it is a bit hypocritical given that originally they both sang out against the corporations and are now part of them (so to speak), but if you don't want to support them anymore - fine. don't buy their records but don't waste time forcing other people to do the same. 
<br /><br />Of course, you get extremists too. People who make literally any excuse to justify a bands selling out: 
<br /><br />- &quot;they actually recorded their stuff on a cd instead of relying on shit recorded by fans at their show on a mobile phone. sellouts&quot;.
<br /><br />- &quot;More than 5 people turned up to their show last night. sellouts.&quot;
<br /><br />- &quot;They're giving away t-shirts! sellouts&quot;
<br /><br />.etc .etc .etc
<br /><br />therefore, i conclude that the only way for a band to avoid selling out, is to not exist.
<br /><br />No-one will ever agree with absolutely everyone on what music they like - no-one can and that's precisely the point of music. listen to the stuff you like and don't listen to the stuff you don't. simple.
<br /><br />this neatly brings me on to my second topic. I've noticed on certain websites on the intertwat (punknews.org is one of the main culprits) that the so called 'punks' thatpost there are constantly bitching about which bands are the best and &quot;you shouldn't like this band, you should like this one&quot;. CUNTS! call yourself punk with an attitude like that? in my view punk is supposed to do away with dictating what people SHOULD do and what they SHOULD like and give people options (&quot;personally i don't like this band, but if you do, i'm cool with that&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> sorta thing. saldy i'm not really seeing any of this - check out the site and i can almost guarantee that about 80-90% of posts made are arguments between whether  the band is good or not and which bands are better, arguments in which people thrust their opinions on one-another and try to close minds instead of open them.
<br /><br />Shame on you all. individuality and choice are the whole point of punk, let people decide for themselves what they like and don't decide for them.
<br /><br />sorry for the long read, was just bugging me.

<br /><br />why soup cans in particular? pasta has labels, most bread does nowadays (unless you're hxE or whatever and bake your own), so do soft drinks, cds and pretty much every consumer product so why soup?
<br /><br />I really am genuinely interested so if anyone knows the answer, you know how to leave me a comment (I hope), a message or a parcel full of money.
<br /><br />personally i love labelling people and i love labelling people because people hate being labelled. it also makes for fun with friends (that old woman is sooo emo), but that's another story, best saved for a night roasting marshmallows over a fireplace with a glass of sherry in hand.
<br /><br />I label myself and i'll label you, i'll label every one of you fuckers. there's no escape.
<br /><br />Unless you're a soup can.

<br /><br />pete sed: 
<br />&quot;The truth is on the way out the door I had to pass directly next to the guy and I knew it, so I kept my head down and walked out. As I did, the guy reached out and grabbed me and said something I couldn't really hear — it was a glorious use of the English language, though,&quot; he continued. &quot;As he grabbed me, I punched him.&quot;
<br /><br />yep, so being grabbed constitutes a full on punch. interesting logic. he them goes on about defending himself and how he's 'in the right', but after the guy had got punched wentz's security team saved him the hassle of dirtying his hands and beat the shit out of the poor guy. blood everywhere apparently.
<br /><br />hope the guy recovers soon (the heckler not wentz)
<br /><br />Lesson: don't diss fall out boy. i hear they're tapping the phones next, then the feds'll take you to guantanamo and torture you til you like them.
<br /><br />oh and if you're gonna go on at me for hating pete wentz, please do because unlike some people i don't need a security team to fight my battles for me.

I must be losing my controversial touch, but anyways as hated as the emo culture is, i have to say i have shitloads of respect for them because, to be honest, they take so much shit thesedays that hating on emo is actually becoming more popular than liking it, and where's the fun in hate?
<br /><br />hate leads to divisions, divisions lead to violence and this creates more hate which ain't good.
<br /><br />you gotta have balls to be emo thesedays.
<br /><br />power to them and fuck the haters!

<br />my friend almost hit him with a bottle though. was only a couple of feet off and this crazy ass chav girl wasnt amused with our efforts to make a circle pit and smacked me in the head. I then told her to fuck off, turned around and got kicked in the back by one of her many 'boyfriends'.

<br /><br />i've tried listening to lots of it, and it makes me really depressed so i hate to think what it'd do to people who listen to it all day everyday. 
<br />i also noticed that a lot of the lyrics seemed to be designed to make impressionable teenagers feel worthless and hated even if their lives aren't even that bad and they seem to romanticise (proabably splt wrong) self-harm and suicide:
<br /><br /><span class="quote"><strong><a href="#" class="toggleQuote toggled" onclick="ComCore.Quotes.toggle (this); return false;">-</a> <a href="/Hawthorne Heights">Hawthorne Heights:</a></strong><br /><span class="quoteContents">And I can't make it on my own.
<br />(And I can't make it on my own.)
<br />Because my heart is in Ohio.
<br />So cut my wrists and black my eyes.
<br />(Cut my wrists and black my eyes)
<br />So I can fall asleep tonight, or die.
<br />Because you kill me.
<br />You know you do, you kill me well.
<br />You like it too, and I can tell.
<br />You never stop until my final breath is gone.</span></span>
<br /><br />to me it just seems to make suicide seem romantic and though i know people will say 'they're only lyrics', that's true but many people  -especially teenagers- who listen to this over and over and have it drilled firmly in their brain may start to believe it especially the younger kids who maybe take it more seriously as they tend to be more impressionable.
<br /><br />I think i've made my point, if anyone wants to argue with me about it, Cool! i love a good argument - preferably with someone intelligent who doesn't just say shit like &quot;omfg u hate emo u fuking twat&quot; and can make a reasoned argument.
<br /><br />Oh, and i should probably add that i've noticed that losing girlfriends features a lot in emo music and seems to be the cause of self harm and killing yaself in the songs.  i have never had a girlfriend (guess i'm just too damn ugly), so going on that principle i should have killed myself ages ago.
<br />shame i don't really do depression...
<br /><br />that's all folks, and remember: 
<br />NO-ONE SHOULD EVER HAVE TO RESORT TO SELF-HARM OR SUICIDE.
<br /><br />ps. should probably write some more cheerful blog thingies...

<br /><br />loads of great bands at the weekend and if you're interested in some awesome ska/punk, check out a band called 'All Sexy But Ginger' i've been to see them a fair few times now and they're great each time.

<br />The only bands i'd possibly go for are The Casualties, Capdown, Mad Caddies, King Blues and Against Me!
<br />and i'm not spending £150 or however much it is for 5 fucking bands.
<br /><br />anyway, city invasion was class. got to see some awesome ska and punk bands. Standouts were probably The Business (70s oi! band), Sonic Boom Six (hip-hop, ska, punk sorta thing), SS-Kaliert (German Street Punk), Random Hand (awesome ska-core band), Conflict (very intense shit, formed from the ashes of Crass) and Leftover Crack, which were just damn amazing.
<br /><br />I can actually remember most of Leftover Cracks setlist so here it is (not in order):
<br /><br />- Life is Pain
<br />- One Dead Cop
<br />- The Good, The Bad and the Leftover Crack
<br />- 500 Channels (Choking Victim)
<br />- So Ya Wanna Be A Cop?
<br />- Gang Control
<br />- War Story (Choking Victim)
<br />- Infested (Choking Victim)
<br />- Baby Punchers
<br />- Atheist Anthem
<br />- Rock The 40 Oz
<br />- Crack City Rockers
<br />- Born to Die (Stza jumped into the crowd right next to me in this one and me and a few other people had to help lift him up and i managed to scream &quot;Born to Die!&quot; into the mic. a memorable moment.)
<br /><br />another memorable moment was after the festival, walking back to the train station where a fucking police van with loads of police with riot gear in the back stops right next to me and my friend. Unluckily, i was wearing a t-shirt which proudly displayed the words &quot;Kill Cops&quot; on it. don't think they'd be to impressed if they saw that, which i don't think they did cause they moved off pretty quick.
<br /><br />cant wait for next year, although I might go to Rebellion or Wasted instead.

<br /><br />1. Being broke (I am usually hard up through living in the middle of fucking nowhere and job opportunities being scarce.)
<br /><br />2. Those complete twats who wear those shit t-shirts that say stuff like 'Rave, Rave, Rave' and 'Drop Beats Not Bombs' on them.
<br /><br />3. First years around college, it was nice and quiet before they came, now i have to shoulder tackle my way to lessons cause they congregate in the middle of the fucking corridors. plus they all seem to be 'new ravers' wearing the brightest shit they can find and having flippy floppy hair.
<br /><br />4. Revising for my Driving Theory Test - yeah, i now have to do 50 questions for mine (tests changed on september 3rd) and not only that, they have the fucking nerve to increase the price by £7. now it's something like £28 to do a theory test. Money grabbing DSA bastards.
<br /><br />5. People who put cliche phrases on their profiles: &quot;Chances are i'll hate you&quot;, &quot;Don't label me&quot;, &quot;I am unique&quot;. yeah, you and everyone else, and stop going on about people who don't conform to your standards being 'sheep', it's getting really fucking old.
<br /><br />note: i may actually be guilty of this by putting &quot;music is my life&quot; on my profile, but, seeing as i am trying to study and become a sound engineer, that may actually come true.
<br /><br />6. People lighting my arm hair when i'm not looking. i don't think it grows back...
<br /><br />7. Converse shoes! wouldn't mind so much if not every single person had a fucking pair. (For the record, i don't).
<br /><br />8. People who put cars as their profile picture. As if people believe you actually have a Bugatti Veyron...
<br /><br />9. Those 'copy &amp; paste' blogs, usually something like: &quot;do you think i'm hot?&quot; or &quot;if we had sex...&quot; Firstly, no i think you're an absolute slag and secondly, no we wouldn't have sex for the aforementioned reason.
<br /><br />and thirdly, the comments you actually get for these blogs are probably from paedophiles.
<br />or really, really, really desperate men. (and they're probably desperate for a reason).

<br /><br />PRICE - I thought 59p was fairly reasonable for 16 biscuits, better than Jammie Dodgers and Maryland Cookies, but not quite as good as Sainsbury's own branded custard creams and bourbons. (7/10)
<br /><br />PACKAGING - I thought the packaging looked distinctly average to be honest, Blue background with white text saying 'Oreos'. Also some text at the top claiming to be 'The World's #1 Biscuit!'. Not exactly modest are they? What pissed me off most about the packaging though, was that they had little diagrams telling you how to eat them. 
<br /><br />I KNOW HOW TO EAT BISCUITS YOU STUPID BLUE BOX AND I'LL EAT THEM HOW I FUCKING LIKE
<br /><br />according to the box, you're supposed to twist the top off biscuit and dunk it in your milk. There really is nothing worse than being told what to do by a piece of cardboard. At least it's recyclable though.
<br /><br />Inside however, we find the usual foil affair, four foil packets, 4 biscuits in each, probably designed for children's lunchboxes. These packages are silver and blue and very shiny, with 'Oreos' printed all over them. They score points for shininess, but they're not recyclable.
<br />(6/10)
<br /><br />APPEARANCE - The biscuits themselves looked alright. Two very black biscuit pieces (not your usual chocolately brown affair) between which is sandwiched white buttercream. They score points for racial unity here, as without either colour the biscuit wouldn't be complete. A nice message for today's society.
<br />(9/10)
<br /><br />TASTE &amp; TEXTURE - A very solid biscuit, doesn't crumble too easily and feels comfortable in the mouth. As for the taste... have you ever eaten a bourbon? Well it's more or less the same to be honest, very disappointed, i expected something new and fresh. Loses marks for unoriginality.
<br />(6/10)
<br /><br />OVERALL - World's #1 Biscuit? Fuck off with your exaggerated claims, they're just bourbon duplicates in a circular shape and different packaging and to be honest you're better off buying Sainsburies own bourbons. I think they're only about 30p and you get just as much.

<br /><br />Now, i'm not actually going to be reviewing the original Jaffa Cakes made by McVities cause you've probably all had them and know what they taste like. Instead i'm going to be reviewing Sainsbury's own brand and see how they measure up to the original.
<br /><br />PRICE - First things first, I payed 52p for a packet of these and each packet contains 12 Jaffa Cakes. This is about the same amount as mcvities yet mcvities are around 72p, so you make a 20p saving!
<br /><br />I like cheap shit, so the price gets my thumbs up (9/10).
<br /><br />PACKAGING - Have to admit, it's not a bad effort on Sainsbury's part, the background of the packaging is a sort of orangey yellow, with a bubbly sort of texture, making it look like slightly like lemon bubblebath.
<br />'Jaffa Cakes' is written in nice big letters, with each letter at a different angle. makes it look a bit more interesting. Wish they could've used a nicer font though, looks like those single letters that you can buy to write stuff on your fridge.
<br />In the top right-hand corner there's also a lovely picture of a jaffa cake, that actually looks really nice and overlapping that is the Sainsbury's 'traffic light' pie chart showing you how good it is for you. It says that each jaffa cake has 1.1g of fat in it. Now i checked mcvities packaging and their jaffa cakes only have 1g of fat in, so if you're slimming or something, have a packet of mcvities and you'll stop yourself from gaining 0.12g (if you eat the entire packet that is).
<br />(8/10)
<br /><br />APPEARANCE - Not much to say here, looks exactly like the mcvities version that we all know and love, which is no bad thing, but they could've made some effort to make them different, like make them into the shape of Bruce Willis or something. Bit lazy keeping 'em circular. (7/10)
<br /><br />TASTE + TEXTURE - Again, almost an exact replica of the original jaffa cakes. The only slight difference being, that I think the Sainsbury's version are slightly drier than the original, but to be honest, you hardly notice it, they still have the same great taste.
<br /><br />For the few of you who've never eaten a jaffa cake (you poor deprived people), then the texture is a bit like eating a very old, crumbly bathroom sponge, topped with marmalade and dark chocolate.
<br /><br />As for taste, the sponge tastes of pretty much like plain cake, and the orange bit is very tangy to nicely balance out the sort of neutral taste of the sponge. (9/10)
<br /><br />OVERALL - They're great. 20p saved, and even I can hardly tell the fucking difference. Of course if you like the really swish blue packaging of the mcvities variety, then these, perhaps, aren't the biscuit (cake<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> for you, but if it's taste you're after, get these bastards instead. (9/10)
<br /><br />VERDICT - FUCKING BUY THEM!
<br />(they're better than the Oreos)
<br /><br />Notes: i do actually have photos of the packaging for each of the biscuits i've reviewed, which i'll probably never get round to putting on the internet, but if you're desperate to see them, they can go on imageshack or something.
<br /><br />I'm also open to suggestions as to what to review next, make sure they're not too expensive mind, and remember i might not be able to get them in Sainsbury's or anywhere else nearby.
<br /><br />cheers,
<br />- TJ

Played an awesome set. quite a small crowd though, only about 100 - 150 people there, made it quite intimate. After much pushing, shoving and a massive punch to the face I got right to the front and stayed there for the entire time they played. got to shout into the mic shitloads of times and mark gave me some lovely haribo sweets he found on the stage.
<br /><br />setlist was roughly this:
<br /><br />- The Brutal Truth (Intro)
<br />- Such Tragedy
<br />- Live in Fear
<br />- No Evacuation
<br />- Police Brutality
<br />- Dead Weight Falls
<br />- Break Away
<br />- False Hope
<br />- Goodbye America
<br />- Social Damage
<br />- Are We Dead Yet?
<br />- Torn and Shattered
<br />- So Sick of You
<br />- Hit and Run
<br />- Right Before Your Eyes
<br />- Paint it Black
<br />- Waste of Time
<br />- On The Other Side
<br />- Scream Out
<br /><br />and probably more i forgot
<br /><br />and there was this crazy drunk guy that kept getting on stage and trying to hug mark and the rest of the band who then stage dived right onto the floor. and probably hurt himself quite a lot.
<br /><br />should be seein em again next february! cannae wait!
<br /><br />- teej
<br /><br />ps. they were supported by splitside, an awesome ska/punk band from sweden. check em out!

I couldn't give a fuck whether people like converse or go to starbucks and the fact that people seek 'friends' based on these decisions beggars belief.
<br /><br />&quot;I eat at mcdonalds&quot; 
<br />&quot;so do I! How amazing&quot;
<br />&quot;let's fuck&quot;
<br /><br />people like you make me actually physically sick - well, not really, but saying that adds phonetic weight to my argument so it gets said.
<br /><br />Do away with brand loyalty and buy something for what it is, rather than who makes it.
<br /><br />Don't I just provide the best advice ever?

<br /><br />I'm skint. and at this moment I have roughly £1.10 to my name. Now i'm willing to bet, that in this day and age I won't be able to afford the series of buses that i'll have to get, to go to a mayfair tomorrow with my friends. I am willing to bet, because i've taken the buses many times before and know how much the fares cost. Therefore I beg of you nice internet people to give me money. i have a paypal if that helps and if anyone wants to help i'll be your friend for-fucking-ever.

<br /><br />remember, i don't care about comments (though it is nice to hear compliments from people i'll never see or meet), if you're going to comment and show your appreciation, that's fine i appreciate your appreciation, but if you're gonna comment me and say something like &quot;you absolute wanker, this page is shit&quot; I will be very pleased because i haven't had any nasty comments yet.

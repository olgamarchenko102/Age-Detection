According to reports, the big Izz Cove of the 31-year-old Russian media said that the concept of the U.S. military out of Avatar is far from cool, he will &quot;take over&quot; a decade create true Avatar. According to reports, he has hired 100 scientists specializing in the human brain transplant to the robot, the human finally forever. This high-tech research project named &quot;Avatar&quot;.

<br />Transplantation of human consciousness, memory, a bold vision to the robot body
<br /><br />Izz Primakov admitted in an interview: &quot;I know, this project is a great challenge for scientists - but I believe you said 'American Dream' (unremitting efforts for the award of a better life), If you can put all their energy, time is invested in something, then you will be able to success in this matter. &quot;
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3Bpolo"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;polo</a> ralph lauren&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
<br />By Izz Cove idea, the expected product in the next 10 years, the human consciousness, perception, memory and other brain can be &quot;transplanted&quot; to a robot's body. He hoped that this process does not require a person into the operating room, the &quot;transplant&quot; effect as if the human soul from the flesh stripped and placed into a mechanical body, physical and mechanical body for the soul are like the empty cocoon clothing .
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3Bwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26lt%3B%2Fb%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt</a>;
<br />&quot;Avatar&quot; this project from the famous director James Cameron movie &quot;Avatar&quot;. This science fiction film about the story between the distant 2154, human and living in Pandora Na'vi people. Story, the human scientists to use cloning technology to human DNA and the DNA of the Na'vi people together, creating a clone Na'vi awareness of human presence which
<br /><br />The human consciousness of the whole process of transplantation ? made &quot;new body&quot; ? ? &quot;to build artificial brains Avatar
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;h<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lisseurghdfrance.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3BGHD%26lt%3B%2Fb%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisseurghdfrance.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;GHD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt</a>;
<br />Izz Cove imagine the next decade, through surgery to people's sense of &quot;transplanted&quot; to the robot's body. Then, without surgery, the human consciousness to the robot, the body eventually become a &quot;shell&quot;, robots have become masters of the soul, life in the new drive shell continuation.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lisseurghdfrance.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3BLisseur"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisseurghdfrance.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lisseur</a> Ghd&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
<br />Specific process includes, in addition to the human consciousness transplantation, scientists have efforts to man-made, a new body, the new body will have a perfect brain-machine interface in order to control the support system of the human brain and the brain can continue outside the body survival. The third stage is to build an artificial brain, through the computer, the mind can be uploaded consciousness.
<br /><br />The ultimate goal is to human consciousness &quot;upload&quot; to the robot. This project to follow James Cameron's movie named &quot;Avatar&quot; in the film, American soldiers of the human mind implanted in the &quot;alien&quot; body, then and in a war in a distant world.
<br /><br />The initial stage of targeting the disabled and dying people
<br /><br />For such a project or system, Izz Primakov said, the first is interested in the disabled and dying people.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lisseurghdfrance.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3Bwww.lisseurghdfrance.net%26lt%3B%2Fb%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisseurghdfrance.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;www.lisseurghdfrance.net&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt</a>;
<br />Izz Primakov said, I hope the matter sorted out the U.S. Department of Defense Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The agency is currently for U.S. forces, remote control robot by the human brain, instead of to the combat in the battlefield. The nickname of this project is the same as the Avatar, at a cost of $ 7,000,000.
<br /><br />According to the 2013 project plan will be developed some of the ways, soldiers and semi-automatic two-pedal machine &quot;interaction&quot; and can become a substitute for soldiers. According to reports, the Izz Cove project in Russia, quite rich pocket to pay the wages of researchers. The Izz Primakov said the cooperation and scientists around the world.

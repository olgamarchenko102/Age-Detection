<br /><br />During one of the hymns, the vicar and myself were both told off.  For playing air-guitar.

<br /><br />Now, I am too p155ed to type deep &quot;fill a sock ickle&quot; thoughts... AND there will be soccer related terms in the following diatribe....
<br /><br />I first saw Man United at Old Trafford in 1966, the days of Bestie, Dennis Law, Bobby, Nobby <em>et al.</em>, and ever since then my life has been blighted.
<br /><br />Because I lived in Bristol, my Dad, knowing that footie was important to a lad (despite him being a rugby-head) took me to the closest League ground - my belovéd Bristol Rovers FC.
<br /><br />So what chance do I have? Just another Man U-loving Gas-head.  There are a lot of us...
<br />...but footie RULES.
<br /><br />Today I am 3 pints less sober than I was 2 hours ago, which for me is a LOT.  When I was younger (started regular drinking at age 15), single figures in a night was a failure, but nowadays, with family, music (yay! music!!!), less funds, and such other excuses, I hardly hit the sauce at all.
<br /><br />But I digress.  The meaning of life, as I apply it to the alleged Beautiful Game is what I discussed with my 80+ -yr-old neighbour, as I was on the way to the pub, he was on his way to the bookie. (He was betting on a Chelski win, I hoped we'd clinch the Premiership at the Bridge)
<br /><br />Why do I love footie so much if all it brings is heartache? Because 
<br />     1) it is what EVERY footie fan does
<br />     2) occasionally it becomes worthwhile. 
<br />There was a game recently.  Man U (obviously) played a supreme match.  No fouls, no petty diving (Diego Drogba, you could be a good player is you let your FOOTBALL do the talking - not your babylike whining, diving, CHEATING antics. And before you all shout back, yeah, Ronaldo too... but also Torres, most Arse players, anyone surnamed Cole, especially if you do the wild thing to some bint whilst married to a member of Girls Aloud - hellooo!!! Ashley, you Tw@t)
<br /><br />I will try that paragraff again
<br /><br />There was a game recently.  Man U (obviously) played a supreme match.  No fouls, no petty diving. just beautifully crafted soccer, with flowing skills, a few goals (I believe that Man U scored 2, which was more than the other team..haha!).  The game was, in a word, BEAUTIFUL.  And THAT is what footie fans wait for.  Every season we have disappointments, ranging from &quot;Oh no, we only won ONE trophy this season&quot; to &quot;Oh no, our club has been wound up for the cost of a top Premier League player's yearly salary&quot;.  One day however, your chosen team will merit the song from the ever -faithful that goes something like &quot;...it's just like watching Brazil...&quot;
<br /><br />Today was not that Day.  Chelski were all over us, 1st half, and why grown men take off their shirts to celebrate a goal is beyond me.  One, it shows how nancyboy they are - blazing hot day, and Bollock was wearing a tee shirt under his team rag.  He'd be mincemeat on a rugby pitch within 2 mins.  And two, it's an automatic yellow card/booking/caution. Dumba55 pr1ck.
<br /><br />Second half, Ronaldo came on.  For Rooney.  Uh-huh, Fergie thnks that the Champions League is a bigger prize.  He played like a pro should, unlike in mid-week.  And should have had a penalty.  True, but blahblah.
<br /><br />United like to win things the ultra-hard way, historically true to say.  So, we will lift that trophy for a second consecutive year (Avram Grant SO does not deserve it...), but not today.
<br /><br />This was not proofread, and I hope my spelinlg [sic] is not too bad, in my giddy stupor.
<br /><br />Rambly rant over.  Jxx

<br />You know how it is
<br />Get so p155ed - then get inspired
<br />To cure the world's ills
<br />{Enough haiku already!}
<br /><br />You must all know that flash of inspiration that hits exactly when you are no fit state to remember it properly.  So ...
<br /><br />1) You just forget it.  
<br />After all, it WAS in your brain, and everything stays there, waiting to re-emerge at some time in the future. Because it WAS there, it IS there and always WILL be there.  Uh-huh...
<br /><br />2) You try and write something down.  
<br />Now, this is fun, because a lot of my life-shattering ideas used to come after I'd been on the sauce.  My writing is bad at the best of times, bad enough for me to be a GP or in IT. Given my penchant for passing out at the sight of blood (especially my own...), the GP route was not open to me, but I DO have a degree in Economics and IT stuff, and had spent several years happily messing about with PCs, laptops, networks, intelligent users and thick-as-shit Directors.
<br />Imagine how bad my scrawl would be, given that I would be 2 steps from unconsciousness as I tried to get the nib/lead/pointer to work on the paper/fag-packet/screen....
<br />3) You tell someone on PAN to remind you in the morning.
<br />Happened recently with a Friend, who said &quot;
<br /><span class="quote"><strong><a href="#" class="toggleQuote toggled" onclick="ComCore.Quotes.toggle (this); return false;">-</a> Quote</strong><br /><span class="quoteContents">Arse - once agaiin I figured out how to make the first million and by morning time forgot...It seemed like a brilliant idea at the time.. after a few beeros that is ..  Next up - setting the world to rights.. </span></span>
<br />...to which I haiku'd in reply
<br /><span class="quote"><strong><a href="#" class="toggleQuote toggled" onclick="ComCore.Quotes.toggle (this); return false;">-</a> Quote</strong><br /><span class="quoteContents">&quot;Set the world to rights&quot;
<br />Used to be my call
<br />Shame that...  -  I am left-handed...  </span></span>
<br />...and s/he then said 
<br /><span class="quote"><strong><a href="#" class="toggleQuote toggled" onclick="ComCore.Quotes.toggle (this); return false;">-</a> Quote</strong><br /><span class="quoteContents">Okay - Project &quot;Set the World to lefts&quot; is all yours - Good luck! </span></span>
<br /><br />I recall it was to do with ducks.  Obviously...
<br /><br />So here is Project Set The World TO Lefts.  Do YOU, dear reader, recall any Bright Ideas that sprang to mnd, the fuzzy subject matter of which you recall, but buggered if you remember WHY, or WHAT it means, or HOW you even remember that much...?
<br /><br />I'll start...

<br /><br />I get lots of crap emails daily - Canadian meds, penile enlargements, £33million from an African prince, online gambling, yadda yadda yadda.  And in a previous life I was in IT/network management, and had to deal with spam for a living (oh, I also had some infuriatingly dim users to shepherd too, but hey ho!)
<br /><br />This morning though, a very clever one.  It was addressed to me proper formally as Mr [Initial] [lastname]
<br />You don't need to know my name, so have changed it in the message to Mr H JakeyDuck....
<br />It had a *.zip file attachment.  I am not stupid enough to open an attached file from a stranger.  Nor should you guys be. Warned, you are.
<br /><br /><strong>Dear Mr H JakeyDuck
<br /><br />This is Mark , how r been? I havn't hear from you in a very long time! Mary asked why didn't you come to our wedding? I was looking forward to see you there then I tried to call you several times  but it seem you changed the number right ? is everything still okay with you ?
<br />Here's some of the wedding pictures :

<br /><br />Check it out and leave some comment for me . Miss u and hope to hear from you soon.

<br /><br />I do not know any couples by those names, my numbers have not altered in at least 10 years - including my mobby! - and I know if I had received a wedding invite! But it is very plausible, and it is human nature to take a peek at the piccies....
<br /><br />That's all, I gotta go hit the roads now, but all I can say is &quot;be careful&quot;

<br />...Mrs Jakey had her 5-0 last weekend.  Happens to a lot of us, it seems.
<br /><br />I discovered that the day she was born, the number one record in the charts was a female singist called Connie Francis, singing &quot;Who's Sorry Now?&quot;.
<br /><br />Well, not me!
<br /><br />MY Number One, when I first drew in a lungful of God's clean air, was a classic too,
<br /><br />&quot;Hoots Mon (as in 'there's a moose loose aboot this hoose')&quot; by the Lord Rockingham XI
<br /><br />So I bought the two singles on eBay and framed them....
<br /><br />Question is this; using a search engine or the Guinness Book of Hit Singles, do you have a classic or a turkey as your own birthdate Number One?  
<br /><br />Dare you tell?
<br /><br />Oh, and US or Irish charts are acceptable, if applicable <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />(Obviously Aussie charts ditto...in fact, whichever country bore you, provided they had pop charts...!!)

<br />I have seen it. Check this out...
<br />We live in an area north of Bristol (UK) called Yate. 
<br />It is known to be a rip-off for fuel - EVERY garage in Yate inflates the prices like a cartel, surrounding areas are all cheaper.
<br />So I fill up 6 miles away when I go past a garage that is 3p cheaper.
<br /><br />Last Tuesday a <strong>TEXACO</strong> garage on the outskirts put unleaded up from £1.18/ltr to £1.21/ltr.
<br />On Friday they increased its unleaded to £1.25/ltr [all typos corrected, thanx Fazerider!]
<br /><br />7 pence a litre in 4 days.  I make that over 30p a gallon up
<br />Bastards.  Unmitigated bastards.   Anyone else had this problem- profiteering from the fuel crisis?
